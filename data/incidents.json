The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!", "field_incident_overview": "<p><em><strong>HTNF Initial Attack Incidents less than 10 acres in size will be placed here.

Smoke has settled into the drainages, so we are not able to see the activity on the spot fires on the northeast side of the main fire. The fire is backing down into Middle Creek drainage.

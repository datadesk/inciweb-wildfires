The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!", "field_incident_overview": "<p><em><strong>HTNF Initial Attack Incidents less than 10 acres in size will be placed here.

Today is expected to be 3-5 degrees cooler with light west winds and gusts of 16-18 mph. Thunderstorms are possible Thursday and more likely Friday and Saturday. The prolonged dry heat has made fuels more receptive, resulting in potential flare-ups in unburned islands within control lines, occasionally producing visible smoke. Firefighters and helicopters are keeping these flare-ups in check.</p><p>As work is completed, resources are being released to assist with other wildfires or will return to their home unit until a new assignment. Firefighters continue to monitor and improve fire lines, retrieve unneeded equipment, while resource advisors and fire archaeologists guide suppression repair to mitigate damage and improve safety. An initial attack group with two hotshot crews, a fire module, and three engines, for a total of 69 personnel, remains available to respond with local resources to any new fires in the area.</p><p>Northern perimeter:&nbsp;<span> </span>Firefighters utilizing aircraft continue to monitor the fire line and manage flare ups, while crews hike into accessible areas to patrol and improve fire lines.</p><p>Suppression Repair:<span>&nbsp; </span>Firefighters and equipment are repairing the damage caused by the suppression of the fire.<span>&nbsp;</span>Water bars are being constructed to reduce erosion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dozers, tree fallers, masticators, and heavy logging equipment are removing hazards and repairing the fire lines to return them to as natural a state as is practical.

In addition to the Sheering Fire, two fires were ignited in the Clavey River drainage, where the 2013 Rim Fire started. Because of their location and the known potential for those fires to become large quickly, they were the top priority for fire resources, including air support. They were fully contained, and then additional resources moved to the Sheering Fire which has burned with low to moderate intensity and a slow rate of spread.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the beginning of the Sheering Fire, fire managers have maintained a full suppression strategy and public and firefighter safety remain the highest priority.

Due to the fire’s location, its slow rate of spread, and its mostly low-intensity fire behavior, fire managers have been able to utilize existing roads and natural features for containment lines in several locations around the fire perimeter, protecting both firefighters and resources in the area.

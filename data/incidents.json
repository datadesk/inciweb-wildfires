Management of chaparral vegetation consists essentially of prescribed burning and wildfire suppression.

Washington, the Three Sisters, and Diamond Peak.</p><p><strong>WILDFIRE ECOLOGY ON THE WILLAMETTE NF:</strong> Periodic fire can be an important part of maintaining diverse and healthy ecosystems. Nearly every region in the country has some kind of fire-dependent plant or tree. Many plants have evolved adaptations that protect them as a species against the effects of fire, and some are even strengthened by it. When fires burn in intervals appropriate to their ecosystem, they consume leaf litter and other ground vegetation like dead wood. This can trigger a rebirth of forests, helping to maintain native plant species.</p><p>Wildfires have always occurred in the Oregon Cascades in what are now wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows fire suppression but does not allow people to interfere with the natural recovery of these areas. No timber harvest or replanting is allowed. &nbsp;Read more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/willamette/learning/nature-science/?cid=fseprd578185\"><strong>Wildfire Recovery and Ecology</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>AN EVOLUTIONARY DANCE - NEWTS AND GARTER SNAKES:</strong> The Willamette National Forest is home to two species engaged in an evolutionary “arms race” that has been ongoing for millions of years.&nbsp;

Fire around the confluence of Horse Creek and the East Fork Kaweah River burned at low to moderate intensity while staying within its current footprint. Hotshot crews conducted burnout operations and worked with air operations to construct and strengthen control lines around Homers Nose.</span><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Today, aerial operations will continue to support crews with tactical retardant drops as they construct direct handline on the north and south sides of Horse Creek and around Homers Nose. In addition, water drops will be used to cool the fire, slowing its spread, allowing firefighters safer opportunities to engage. Firefighters will continue to check for hotspots, strengthen lines, and backhaul equipment along the southern and western flanks of the fire.</span></p><p><span><strong>WEATHER:&nbsp;</strong>As the trough moves eastward, expect a cooler day with steady humidity and lighter afternoon winds, creating a calm and stable atmosphere. The trough’s progression will bring slightly milder conditions, reducing the intensity of both heat and wind while maintaining clear skies. This stable weather pattern should hold throughout the day, offering no significant fluctuations in temperature or moisture levels.</span></p><p><strong>SMOKE IMPACTS:</strong><span>&nbsp;Air quality conditions greatly improved throughout the outlook area due to moderate fire activity. Today expect GOOD air quality conditions North and South of the fire, with MODERATE conditions closest to the fire in Hammond and Three Rivers this morning, but clearing to GOOD air quality throughout the forecast area this afternoon.

Along the foothills, the southern flank of the fire has shown little movement, allowing firefighters to construct direct line along the fire’s edge, as well as crews strengthening containment lines by clearing and widening Sunset Peak Road with dozers and hand crews. Crews are monitoring and extinguishing hotspots in the fire’s perimeter up the southwest flank and are feeling confident they can hold containment lines.

A flare-up occurred in an unburned pocket north of Trabuco Canyon, but it remains within the fire's existing perimeter. Crews are conducting reconnaissance along the Santiago Peak fire lines, and heavy equipment operators are constructing a dozer line toward Ortega Highway. Aircraft, such as Air Tankers and helicopters were utilized throughout the afternoon during weather conditions that make up our critical burn period to assist ground crews in containing the Airport Fire. By strategically dropping retardant around the active areas along the fire perimeter, these aircraft helped to mitigate and slow its spread to create a safer working environment for firefighters on the ground.</span></p><p><strong>Evacuations and Warnings: </strong>Evacuation orders and warnings have been issued by the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the Riverside County Sheriff's Office.

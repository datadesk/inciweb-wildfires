Management of chaparral vegetation consists essentially of prescribed burning and wildfire suppression.

Washington, the Three Sisters, and Diamond Peak.</p><p><strong>WILDFIRE ECOLOGY ON THE WILLAMETTE NF:</strong> Periodic fire can be an important part of maintaining diverse and healthy ecosystems. Nearly every region in the country has some kind of fire-dependent plant or tree. Many plants have evolved adaptations that protect them as a species against the effects of fire, and some are even strengthened by it. When fires burn in intervals appropriate to their ecosystem, they consume leaf litter and other ground vegetation like dead wood. This can trigger a rebirth of forests, helping to maintain native plant species.</p><p>Wildfires have always occurred in the Oregon Cascades in what are now wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows fire suppression but does not allow people to interfere with the natural recovery of these areas.

Using tactical water tenders allow aviation support to<br>concentrate on other areas. All spot fires along the northern flank were identified, contained, and<br>extinguished. Moving east along the Kaweah River, firefighters patrolled the fire as it slowly backed down<br>toward the river. In coordination with crews on the ground, drones conducted aerial ignition operations to<br>produce low-intensity fire to moderate the effects around the giant sequoia groves near Eden Creek.

Strategic burning operations were utilized to remove unburned fuels between defensible barriers and the active fire front.  <br />\r\n•\tOn the north part of the Rail Ridge Fire, the focus was stopping the fire from spreading into the Deep Creek drainage to keep the fire away from structures in this area. <br />\r\n•\tAlong the west side of the Rail Ridge fire, firing operations were used to connect lines that were built over the last few days. Crews continued strategic structural point protection, as safe to do so, while continuing to stop the fire’s spread along these planned lines. <br />\r\n•\tOn the south part of the fire, similar operations to the western side were put in place.

Mechanical equipment was used to reduce fuel loading along planned control lines.<br />\r\nToday’s Activities – Firing operation on the eastern flank may create smoke visible from nearby areas. More crews, engines, and heavy equipment will be arriving today. Firefighters will continue to focus on building new line where needed and strengthening the existing fire barriers that have been established.

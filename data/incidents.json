Firefighters used a combination of direct hand line and natural features such as rock faces and boulders along the fire's edge to gain as much containment as possible. Where the fire was not accessible by foot due to hazards and safety concerns firefighters used helicopters to drop water and keep the fire confined to these natural features. Firefighters also constructed contingency line (a fuel break) around the De La Cour Lavender Ranch on Horseshoe Meadows Road, located within the Carroll Creek drainage.</p><p>The first firefighters that arrived on scene did not see any signs of human activity near the fire and there was no lightning activity in the area. This, paired with the limited accessibility by foot, a fire cause could not be determined.</p><p>On November 7 the fire was mapped at 6.4 acres, and hotshot crews assigned to the incident continued coordinating water drops by helicopter as necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 14 and 15, snow fell over the fire area. The fire was contained and controlled, and placed in patrol status on November 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Although no smoke was showing, fires always have the potential to have small, interior pockets of heat until enough precipitation fully extinguishes it. For the following week, the area continued to show no visible smokes even though two wind events passed during that week's timeframe.</p><p>On the evening of November 22, a member of the public reported seeing flames on Horseshoe Meadows Road at 8:19 p.m. and first responders were dispatched to it.</p><p>Evacuations were issued by Inyo County Sheriff's Office for Zone 223A, which included the De La Cour Lavender Ranch. Later, evacuations expanded to other areas, Zones 193, 195, and 197.</p><p>At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 23, this fire made a significant run downslope from the strong west winds spotting embers in several directions, crossing over Horseshoe Meadows Road and spreading east. By 6:30 a.m. the fire had grown to approximately 4,537 acres. By this time, the fire had significantly slowed its rate of spread and received precipitation on it.</p><p>Due to the aggressive firefighting efforts and aided by significant precipitation, containment reached 95% by the evening of November 25.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horseshoe Fire continued to have sections of open fire line in areas completely inaccessible by firefighters due to terrain, and was continually checked on a regular basis for infrared heat and smoke, until it was determined to be 100% contained on January 28, 2025.</p><p>In the most severely burned areas and steep drainages, safety hazards will also exist for some time, such as debris flows, flooding and rock fall. Due to the se hazards, the Inyo County Sheriff's Office may need to reissue evacuation orders, warnings, or advisories.

The fire was estimated at 9,000 acres acres as mapped by fire air intel and is burning east-northeast onto the Carrizo Plain. Los Padres is in Unified Command with CALFIRE SLU and the Bureau of Land Management. A full response was initiated that included seven air tankers, and two helicopters along with multiple engines and hand crews.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CURRENT SITUATION: </strong>A<span>Yesterday, the hard work firefighters put in paid off two-fold: by strengthening perimeter lines, the overall containment increased, and by seeking out isolated hot spots and extinguishing them. Concerns that some had just a few days ago have been relieved. On the west flank, firefighters' work was validated by an infrared (IR) flight, which showed that the majority of the remaining heat signatures were ash pits and stump holes. As more areas become available for suppression repair, the focus is given to restoring roads and fences to return them to their pre-fire state. On the southeast flank, where the majority of the uncontained perimeter line remains, crews are actively patrolling the area and extinguishing any hotspots, thereby reducing residual heat. Suppression units continue to hold and improve containment lines by mopping up 300 feet into the black; this ensures the fire will not progress beyond the existing perimeter. Hwy 166 is open to all vehicle traffic. We ask the public to exercise extreme caution when traveling as firefighters, heavy equipment, and crews continue to work along and near the roadway.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>EVACUATIONS:</strong></span></p><p><span>Please use caution when driving near the fire area as firefighters, equipment and crews are still working along the roadways.

In areas being used by these aircraft, boaters should move toward the shore to ensure the safety of our aircraft, safety of recreational boaters, and to ensure that suppression of the Green Fire will not be hindered.</p><p><strong>FIRE ACTIVITY:</strong> We again experienced widespread temperatures over 100 degrees, coupled with dry and windy conditions that favored active fire behavior. The north side of the fire in the area of Alder Springs, continued to back down toward the area previously burned during the Shoe Fire. On the east side of the fire, where the fire has crossed Flat Creek, crews and aircraft were used to limit growth. &nbsp;Crews have continued to strengthen the fire line along Rip Gut Ridge, adding water pumps and hose lays in preparation for firing operations. To the south, the fire has reached the Pit River where suppression watercraft were used to secure the fire, resulting in containment of the fire along a portion of the river. To the southwest, the fire has moved across the Brock Mountain Road (FS RD 35N02). The remainder of the Brock Mountain Road to the west and northwest remains secure.</p><p><strong>FIRE WEATHER:</strong> Today will bring conditions similar to the last two days which have resulted in active fire behavior and growth. Temperatures may surpass 100 degrees, and relative humidity may reach a low of approximately 15 percent. Moderate winds will be out of the northeast in the morning but shifting to the south in the afternoon. Throughout the weekend and into Monday we will have dry conditions that persist through the night. All these factors contribute to the likelihood of active fire behavior.</p><p><strong>FIRE OPERATIONS:</strong> <span>Operational priorities include holding the Brock Mountain Road that forms the primary containment line along the west flank of the fire; continuing firing operations to strengthen fireline to the north and northeast of the fire; finishing the southernmost portion of the east fireline that connects with the Pit River; and, ensuring that the Green Fire remains north of the Pit River. &nbsp;</span>Primary fire lines have been constructed along Rip Gut Ridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, crews successfully implemented a firing operation off the Rip Gut Ridge fire line near where the line connects to the Shoe Fire. Operations today emphasized holding and improving that fire line. As nighttime conditions allow, they will continue to advance that firing operation southward. Further to the east along the Fenders Ferry Road, crews and equipment have advanced contingency line southward to the Pit River. To the south, suppression watercraft will provide 24-hour coverage along the Pit River as the fire continues to back down to the river. Along the fire’s west flank, operations staff plan to aggressively hold the fire along the Brock Mountain Road where it has not yet crossed the road. Air operations have added the use of two Super Scooper aircraft that will provide additional aerial support to ground crews throughout the area of the Green Fire.</p><p>Please continue to avoid the area and stay tuned to official updates.

Firefighters continue to make progress on several fronts. Fire lines near White Sage community are holding well, and crews remain actively engaged to ensure that area stays secure. Firefighters continue to strengthen and secure containment lines around the Lonesome Ranch area to protect private lands.</p><p>On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers are working uphill toward Highway 89A. Although some spotting has occurred by wind-carried embers ahead of the main fire, the spread has remained minimal. Fire behavior in this area remains moderate due to active suppression efforts.</p><p>To the east and north, the fire is experiencing rapid growth, particularly within the 2020 Mangum Fire footprint. Grasses and standing dead trees are contributing to intense fire activity. The fire is pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, prompting crews to begin assessing opportunities for tactical firing operations. This creates a buffer zone of removed fire fuels, helping to slow or halt the fire's progress. The Winter Road, which was previously prepped with fuel reduction work during the 2020 Mangum Fire, is being accessed as a potential containment line to limit further growth to the north. No structures have been lost.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finciweb.wildfire.gov%2Fincident-information%2Fazgcp-dragon-bravo-fire&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cdagarcia%40blm.gov%7Cc43c7838dabd44393fbf08ddc229e69d%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C638880207598911290%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=QlhwtdxAYHyf9FEe3zPPCvGm7XaZg8fKVqzIhQDOzxY%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>Bravo Dragon Fire</strong></span></a>&nbsp;is 35 miles south of the White Sage Fire at Grand Canyon National Park.</p><h5><strong>Fire Behavior</strong></h5><p>Hot, dry, and windy conditions continue to challenge firefighting efforts. This, combined with record-high Energy Release Components (ERCs), a measurement of how dry and flammable the vegetation is, is creating a volatile environment. These high ERCs indicate that fuels are ready to ignite easily and support extreme fire behavior. Despite the challenging conditions, crews are maintaining focus on containment strategies while prioritizing the safety of communities.</p><h5><strong>Evacuations</strong></h5><p>Evacuation information is being updated regularly by Coconino County.

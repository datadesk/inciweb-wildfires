Forest vegetation is classified into two major types: chaparral (68%) and forested lands (30%). Forested land includes mixed evergreen forests, oak woodland, pinyon-juniper woodland, and conifer forest. Management of chaparral vegetation consists essentially of prescribed burning and wildfire suppression.

The Big Canyon Fire, burning in extreme terrain in the Deer Creek drainage, was the only fire not able to be lined by the end of the day.  he ODF Northeast Oregon District, by that evening, had no additional resources but for firefighter resolve to hold the fires they had caught.

The Type 3 team had only three more days of availability. There was a lack of overhead to manage the resources necessary and maintain an adequate span of control.<br />\r\n•\tA lack of available suppression resources nationally.<br />\r\n•\tThe inability to execute an alternate suppression strategy if the Big Canyon Fire escaped its primary line. The desire to secure these fires at 800 to 1000 acres prior to the forecast weather which included 90-to-105-degree temperatures, critically low relative humidities and dry lighting  impacting the area within a 5-day period.<br />\r\n•\tIn sum, these factors equate to likely difficulty to contain and hold all of these fires.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the severity and increasing complexity of the situation, the ODF Northeast Oregon District ordered the Oregon Department of Forestry Incident Management Team 2 (ODF IMT 2). The team was activated and tasked with mobilizing as rapidly and safely as possible to relieve the Blue Mountain Type 3 team under a delegation of authority between the Oregon Department of Forestry and the USFS Wallowa-Whitman National Forest.

Jefferson Wilderness, a variety of backpacking and day hiking opportunities, waterfalls, and much more! Seven major volcanic peaks rise within the Forest's Wilderness areas: Mt. Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack, Mt. Washington, the Three Sisters, and Diamond Peak.</p><p>Wildfire Ecology in on the Willamette: Periodic fire can be an important part of maintaining diverse and healthy ecosystems. Nearly every region in the country has some kind of fire-dependent plant or tree. Many plants have evolved adaptations that protect them as a species against the effects of fire, and some are even strengthened by it. When fires burn in intervals appropriate to their ecosystem, they consume leaf litter and other ground vegetation like dead wood. This can trigger a rebirth of forests, helping to maintain native plant species.</p><p>Wildfires have always occurred in the Oregon Cascades in what are now wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows fire suppression but does not allow people to interfere with the natural recovery of these areas. No timber harvest or replanting is allowed. &nbsp;Read more about <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/willamette/learning/nature-science/?cid=fseprd578185\">Wildfire Recovery and Ecology</a>.</p><p><strong>Strube Camp</strong> - A historical camp, is also being used for Fire Camp on the North Willamette Complex. &nbsp;Of the several stories that have appeared about the origin of the camp name, Bill Lynch (1979) wrote the true story in the Eugene Register-Guard in 1979: “…apparently at the turn of the century a German-born cattleman by the name of Strube regularly drove herds of beef from Central Oregon to the Willamette Valley and had a cattle camp on the South Fork of the McKenzie River.<span>&nbsp; </span>The place became known as Strube Camp.<span> &nbsp;More information available from </span><a href=\"https://inciweb-prod-media-bucket.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2024-08/Strube%20Camp%20Docs.pdf?VersionId=p_y5hYChhcgYhRbkgZVVSsJK6GVW1mcQ\"><span>this historic document</span></a>.</p><p><strong>MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES: </strong>Ensure that strategies and tactics have a high probability of success and provide for firefighter and public safety through sound risk management process.

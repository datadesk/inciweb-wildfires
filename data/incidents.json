Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023.

The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.</p><p>A few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist. Through the heat of the day ground and air resources made good progress with cooling off the fire and constructing fire line.&nbsp;</p><p>By the evening weather conditions started to deteriorate with t-storms and rain moving into the fire area. Aviation resources (due to the weather conditions) had to disengage from the fire, as well as ground fire crews due to lightning exposure. Rain did reach the fire area and crews eventually reengaged the fire. Crews staffed the fire overnight with no flareups to the fire line.</p><p><strong>Plans for today 8/1/2025</strong></p><p>Crews will continue to construct fire line around the fire perimeter, mainly chainsaw (saw) and cold trialing the fires edge. Mop up operations will begin to secure all fire line within a certain depth which will prevent any future threats. Fire crews will look to have the Muddy fire fully contained by the end of shift on 8/1/2025.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update:</strong></p><p>*Fire perimeter resized to 4 acres.</p><p>*Fire crews have been actively engaged with fire line construction.

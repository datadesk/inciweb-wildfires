At this stage, crews will continuously work deeper interior from the fires edge digging out ash pits, digging/grubbing up hot roots and smoldering duff that could cause issues if not addressed. Fire crews continue to staff the fire overnight. Adverse weather conditions continue to be an issue for the fire crews working the Muddy fire due to t-storms and lightning in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8/2/2025</strong></p><p>All fire lines held overnight on the Muddy Fire. Crews remained in place through the night and are back in action for the day shift. Overall plan for the weekend will be finalizing containment around the fires edge on the Muddy Fire. Crews will continue mop up operations, working the fire line edge, securing, patrolling and working deeper interior. Fire behavior has significantly decreased to smoldering and creeping. Fire crews could face another day of challenging fire weather conditions with possible afternoon t-storms and higher winds. Overall, crews continue to produce good safe work.</p><p>The next update for the Muddy Fire will be Monday 8/4/2025, unless any significant events happen.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/1/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Muddy Fire Update:</p><p>* 30% Containment</p><p>* Revised fire perimeter to 3 acres.</p><p>*All fire lines held overnight.</p><p>*Fire crews will continue the construction of fire line and engage in mop up operations.</p><p><strong>Previous day recap</strong>: Fire crews responded to a new start located 2 miles East of the Paonia Reservoir late morning. The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.</p><p>A few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist. Through the heat of the day ground and air resources made good progress with cooling off the fire and constructing fire line.&nbsp;</p><p>By the evening weather conditions started to deteriorate with t-storms and rain moving into the fire area. Aviation resources (due to the weather conditions) had to disengage from the fire, as well as ground fire crews due to lightning exposure. Rain did reach the fire area and crews eventually reengaged the fire. Crews staffed the fire overnight with no flareups to the fire line.</p><p><strong>Plans for today 8/1/2025</strong></p><p>Crews will continue to construct fire line around the fire perimeter, mainly chainsaw (saw) and cold trialing the fires edge. Mop up operations will begin to secure all fire line within a certain depth which will prevent any future threats. Fire crews will look to have the Muddy fire fully contained by the end of shift on 8/1/2025.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update:</strong></p><p>*Fire perimeter resized to 4 acres.</p><p>*Fire crews have been actively engaged with fire line construction. Good progress has been made.</p><p>*Incoming weather has disengaged fire suppression aircraft</p><p>*The Muddy fire is currently receiving light rain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All ground crews will remain on scene of the Muddy fire overnight. Current fire behavior has decreased due to suppression activities and weather conditions.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Active Wildfire Alert!</p><p>Fire name: Muddy Fire</p><p>Location: 2 Miles East of Paonia Reservoir, Gunnison County, off Hwy 133 located on BLM land.</p><p>Size: Currently 5 acres</p><p>Cause: Lightning</p><p>Fuels burning: Oak Brush</p><p>Current Status: Active fire behavior, fire resources currently on scene and engaged with fire.

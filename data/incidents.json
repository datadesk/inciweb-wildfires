Shasta with its impressive elevation of 14,179&nbsp;feet.</p><p><span>The Shasta-Trinity National Forest area is one of the most culturally complex regions in California encompassing a varied and rich Native American cultural heritage. Cultural resources distributed throughout the forest, range from archaeological remains of past life ways to sacred sites utilized by contemporary Native American peoples. The forest works with eleven&nbsp;federally recognized tribes include the Redding Rancheria, Resighini Rancheria, Pit River Tribe, Hoopa Valley Tribe, The Klamath Tribes, Quartz Valley Indian Reservation, Round Valley Reservation, Yurok Tribe,&nbsp;the Karuk Tribe, Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians, and Moduc Nation of Oklahoma; and with eight&nbsp;non-federally recognized tribes include Winnemem Wintu Tribe, Tsnungwe Tribe, Nor-Rel-Muk Wintu Nation, Wintu Tribe of Northern California and Toyon-Wintu Center, Wintu of Hayfork, The Moduc Nation, The Shasta Nation&nbsp;Inc., and Shasta Indian Nation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The STNF includes portions of five designated Wilderness Areas: Castle Crags, Chanchellulla, Mount Shasta, Trinity Alps and Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel. The main branch of the Trinity River is a designated Wild and Scenic River which runs through the forest.

The project area is located near Gross Reservoir and Winiger Ridge in Boulder County, Colo. The entire project area encompasses 18,954 acres; 9,940 of those acres are National Forest System lands, 1,892 acres are Boulder County Parks and Open Space lands, and 7,122 acres are private lands. Elevation ranges from 6,082 to 8,945 feet. The project is generally located east of Nederland, CO and west of Gross Reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The broadcast burn units from the Forsythe II Decision are located 7 miles southwest of Boulder and 5.5 miles east of Nederland and total 931 acres. Forest thinning and pile burning treatments for areas near the planned prescribed burn area are mostly complete. The area has two main burn units that are subdivided into multiple sub-units that vary in size from 18 acres to 130 acres to provide a variety of options for control using existing roads, water, natural features and control lines, up to 340 acres per year. The prescribed burning treatments will be implemented over several years, with the amount treated per year dependent on weather, ground conditions, and available resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All burning will be implemented in close coordination and with assistance from local cooperating agencies and partners, including Boulder Watershed Collective, Boulder County Fireshed, state and county public health agencies, and multiple local agency fire cooperators.</p><p><span>Smoke will be in the air, and fire managers work closely with experts to minimize the impacts to the extent possible. Air quality is carefully monitored before and during a prescribed fire and all prescribed burns comply with state air quality regulations to minimize impacts to communities.

These projects will continue through 2023 and into spring 2024. These fuel treatment operations will include vegetation thinning, cutting and piling, mastication, prescribed fire by burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.&nbsp; Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely in fire prone areas and improve forest health. To view project information for each district please go to projects page: </span><a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-publication/cacnf-2024-cleveland-national-forest-fuel-treatments/2024-cnf-projects-01-01-2024\"><span>2024 CNF Projects</span></a></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>The objective of the projects is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape. In fiscal year 2023, the Forest's target for fuels reduction is 6,900 acres. 2,400 acres of planned prescribed fire, and 3,500 acres of mechanical treatments which is a combination of mastication, cut and pile with chainsaws.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully managed and monitored.

Landscapes were chosen based on the potential for wildfire to affect nearby communities, critical infrastructure, public water sources, and Tribal lands. The Forest was positioned well given current efforts around the Nevada Shared Stewardship Agreement, an interagency collaboration effort that has previously identified wildfire crisis landscapes across the state based on similar threats to public and private land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe wildfire crisis landscape projects are a large-scale effort to reduce the risk of wildfire to protect at-risk communities and critical infrastructure, while also increasing the landscape’s resilience and ability to survive the effects of changing climates and other stressors such as insects, disease, and invasive species. Selected wildfire crisis landscapes will advance the goals of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy by utilizing the best available science and strategic network of hazardous fuels and vegetation treatments to reduce wildfire risk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWildfire crisis landscapes, also known as firesheds, are large forested and rangeland areas where communities, infrastructure, and natural resources are at the highest risk to be impacted by wildfire. Examples include critical watersheds and wildlife habitats; utility, energy, and mining facilities; transportation corridors; and recreation areas. Several high-risk fire sheds were identified on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, including the Sierra and Elko Fronts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombined with the initial ten selected landscapes in 2022, the wildfire crisis landscape projects now span nearly 45 million acres across 137 of the 250 high-risk firesheds in the western United States. More than $930 million will be invested in 21 landscapes across 26.7 million acres. This work will mitigate risk to approximately 200 communities within these selected landscapes.", "field_incident_overview": "<p>Here’s more info on what we have going on!!&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/prescribedfireis?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWhihRWXoujGsIOKhiF2bzIhq9Dn8qmq4K_Jxfahh8YP11Chq-_D71rY09MMvUjtJf1SdT53Ddk5dNmxrHjPEfIpCIfr2-M-vDiIN-9tX38iDmDJ5qury9FWIksl8nutrG9p_DRWFUPF_4jqoLFXfy8DCuhmr8rAiFjNQYs8cNA9Gu-wDBkuxY5iL0Ycmj_3u4&amp;__tn__=*NK-R\"><span>Prescribed Fire is</span></a> an important tool for decreasing long-term fire risk to communities and restoring our forests, so they are more resilient to natural fire in the future. <span>Prescribed fires, also known as prescribed burns, refer to the controlled application of fire by a team of fire experts under specified weather conditions to restore health to ecosystems that depend on fire.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>CURRENT STATUS&nbsp;</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Sierra Front (Includes Carson and Bridgeport Ranger Districts) - 100 Personnel</strong></li></ul><p>Reno, NV - Dog Valley RX (343 Acres) -<em><strong> Mopping up today.</strong></em> <em><strong>302</strong></em> <em><strong>total</strong></em> <em><strong>acres treated 4/20/24</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Mitchell Canyon RX - <em><strong>Mop up in progress. 91 acres treated 4/20/24</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - White's Creek RX - <em><strong>Mop up in progress. 21 acres treated 4/19/24</strong></em></p><p>Walker, CA - Mill Canyon RX - <em><strong>UPCOMING</strong></em> <em><strong>Burning planned for 4/23/24</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Spring Mountains National Recreation Area&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Southern Nevada - Cole Springs RX - <em><strong>NO BURNING TODAY</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em>McFarland RX -<em><strong> NO BURNING TODAY</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Mountain City, Ruby Mountains, Jarbidge Ranger Districts&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Ruby Valley, NV - Ruby Lake Estates RX - <em><strong>NO BURNING TODAY</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please do not call 911.

", "field_incident_overview": "<p>Every spring and fall, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, along with its interagency partners and neighbors, plans to implement prescribed fire projects, as weather and fuels conditions allow.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Prescribed fires are carefully planned and conducted in accordance with a written burn plan. Prior to implementation, Forest fire managers coordinate with local cooperators, county officials, and interagency partners. When prescription criteria are met, firefighters implement, monitor, and patrol each burn to ensure it meets forest health and public safety objectives. All prescribed fires will be implemented in compliance with Montana air quality standards and coordinated with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the appropriate county health departments to minimize the impacts of smoke. Smoke may pool in drainage bottoms and along highway corridors overnight; impacts are expected to dissipate in a few days.</p><p><br>Why use prescribed fires? Prescribed fires help reduce surface fuels, increasing landscape wildfire resilience and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects on the landscape. In addition, they improve and maintain forest health and wildlife habitat and eliminate invasive species. The forest ecosystems in the Northern Rockies have evolved with fire, with many of them relying on periodic fires to establish and maintain forest health.&nbsp;</p><p>Benefits of prescribed fire as a forest management tool:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protects communities and infrastructure by reducing hazardous fuels and the risk of future high-intensity wildfires.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigates future wildfire risk and promote resilient fire-adapted landscapes.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduces build-up of flammable vegetation, dead and down trees, and overgrowth.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improves and supports wildlife habitat for many species on the Forest.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits the spread of invasive plant species and minimizes the spread of pest insects and disease, maintaining native ecosystems.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycles nutrients back into the soil.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotes the growth of trees, plants, wildflowers, and other flora and fauna.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continues the historic, natural fire regime of periodic disturbance by fire in forested ecosystems.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we plan? Prescribed fires are planned for various units across the Forest; however, the window of opportunity for prescribed fire implementation is affected by several factors. Safety factors, weather conditions, air quality, personnel availability, and environmental regulations are continually monitored before implementation to determine feasibility of moving forward with the prescribed fire operations, during implementation, and after completion of the unit(s).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Public notifications: Prior to initiating the prescribed fires, fire professionals assess conditions, conduct a test burn, and notify local governments and interested publics via website postings, email, social media, and news releases. Implementation and accomplishment updates will also be posted to the Forest website, Inciweb, and the Forest Facebook page.</p><p><br>Safety and monitoring: Trained fire professionals who have studied fire behavior and fire control techniques conduct prescribed fires in such a way to ensure the safety of the fire crew, nearby residents, and property.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "", "field_title_and_unit": "MTBDF BeaverheadDeerlodge NF Prescribed Fire Operations", "field_unit_code": "MTBDF", "id": "317157", "lat_deg": "45", "lat_min": "35", "lat_sec": "55.38", "long_deg": "113", "long_min": "7", "long_sec": "11.42", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "", "title": "Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF Prescribed Fire Operations", "type": "Prescribed Fire", "urlPath": "/mtbdf-beaverheaddeerlodge-nf-prescribed-fire-operations"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-115.502639, 46.640825], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "7 hours 24 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2024-04-18T12:35:23-04:00\">2024-04-18</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span>The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation have begun prescribed burns on the North Fork Clearwater Ranger District to improve elk habitat.

Historically, fire was ignited by lightning and by Indigenous people tending the land. Fire in its natural role reduces dead vegetation, replenishes nutrients in the soil, stimulates new growth, and maintains biological diversity.</p><p>Fire was effectively removed from these systems with the arrival of settlers. After many years of fire exclusion, an ecosystem that needs periodic fire becomes unhealthy. Trees become stressed by overcrowding, fire-dependent species disappear, and an unnatural buildup of flammable fuels that can become hazardous when wildfires occur. Over a century of fire suppression has resulted in wildfires burning more severely than they historically did, threatening communities and ecosystems.</p><p>“Prescribed fire is an excellent opportunity to reintroduce a natural process and critical element back into the ecosystem on our terms and in strategic locations,” said Kelsey Lofdahl, Assistant Forest Fire Management Officer on the Klamath National Forest. “It is one of the most useful tools to help reduce fuels, restore our forests, and protect our communities and natural resources.”</p><p>Recent research conducted by the Pacific Southwest Research Station on the Klamath National Forest has illustrated the effectiveness of prescribed burning at reducing the severity of wildfires within treated areas. The study, released in February of this year, found that where the 2021 Antelope Fire intersected with previously completed fuels treatments, including prescribed burning, the severity of the burned area decreased compared to untreated areas.</p><p>Several prescribed burns are planned across the Klamath National Forest this spring. Timing of implementation will be dependent on fuel and weather conditions at each specific project location.</p><p>Happy Camp/Oak Knoll Ranger District<br>•The Cade Mountain prescribed burn (111 acres) is 3 miles northeast of Happy Camp in mixed conifer and hardwood forest. The project aims to reduce fuels in the area and enhance the growth of Hazel for Tribal use.</p><p>Salmon/Scott River Ranger District<br>•Crews plan to pick up where they left off last fall continuing ignitions out at the Scott Bar Mountain prescribed burn (500 acres) about 12 miles west of Fort Jones. The burn goals are to improve defensibility of homes in the area, increase resiliency of the forested stand against future wildfire events, and improve wildlife habitat. Scott Bar Mountain connects to a series of ridgetop fuels treatments, many of which were planned and implemented through collaborative efforts with partners. These treatments create a landscape-scale fuel break that can be used during wildfire events to protect communities, infrastructure, and natural resources.<br>•Just east of the Scott Bar Mountain project area lies the Singleton Project (500 acres), which is in mixed conifer stands and will tie in to the same strategic ridgetop fuel break.</p><p>Goosenest Ranger District<br>•The Van Bremmer (160 acres) and Tamarack (369 acres) underburns are two adjacent projects located three miles northeast of Tennant. The projects’ goals are to reduce hazardous fuels, promote browse for big game, and increase stand resilience against the effects of insects, disease, and wildfire. Both projects are in ponderosa pine stands with an understory of brush and white fir saplings.&nbsp;<br>•The First Creek prescribed burn (up to 1,174 acres) project is north of the Grass Lake Rest Area in mixed conifer with an understory of bitterbrush, manzanita, and snowbrush. Prescribed fire is being used to reduce surface fuel loads and reducing fire-intolerant white fir to create openings that favor fire-tolerant ponderosa pine regeneration.<br>•The Cedar Mountain prescribed burn (up to 3,650 acres) is just north of Antelope Sink, in ponderosa pine stands with areas of juniper and brush. Prescribed fire will be used to reduce fuels to improve defensible space for the community of Tennant and outlying residences. Other goals for the burn are to improve big game habitat, reduce juniper, encourage aspen regeneration, and promote forested stands that are resilient against drought, wildfire, and forest pests.</p><p>Prescribed burning activities on the Klamath National Forest are in conjunction with the efforts of Klamath River Basin Landscape, which is part of the USDA Forest Service’s Wildfire Crisis Strategy.

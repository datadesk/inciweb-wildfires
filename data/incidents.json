The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!", "field_incident_overview": "<p><em><strong>HTNF Initial Attack Incidents less than 10 acres in size will be placed here.

Reports from air resources estimate the fire to be 50-100 acres. The fire is burning in the footprint of a 2017 fire in the Marble Mountain Wilderness near Shelly Lake and the Pacific Crest Trail. Hikers on the PCT must avoid the area between Etna Summit and Shackelford Trailhead.</span></p><p><span>Klamath National Forest immediately dispatched an aggressive response to suppress the fire, ordering numerous air resources and sending a large ground response.</span></p><p><span>As of the evening of July 3rd the Shelly Fire had grown to an estimated 250 acres. Active fire was seen last night until 2:30 AM, and, around 3:00 AM, the fire showed moderate activity. Crews are making progress this morning along the Pacific Crest Trail. Smoke has settled into the drainages, so we are not able to see the activity on the spot fires on the northeast side of the main fire. The fire is backing down into Middle Creek drainage. We anticipate fire activity increasing later today as temperatures increase. Steep, rugged terrain is making access difficult.</span></p><p><span>If you are out on the forest today, please pay attention to where you are in relation to the Shelly Fire, heed any changes in wind direction, be mindful of fire crews and equipment, and remember all fireworks are not permitted on forest lands anytime of the year.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>EVACUATIONS:</strong></span></p><p><span>The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office, with the support of our fire partners, has issued an&nbsp;𝙀𝙑𝘼𝘾𝙐𝘼𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉&nbsp;𝑶𝑹𝑫𝑬𝑹 for the following zone(s):</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7/12/24 at 1:00pm *𝗭𝗢𝗡𝗘 𝟮𝟮𝟭𝟮 𝗛𝗔𝗦 𝗕𝗘𝗘𝗡 𝗦𝗣𝗟𝗜𝗧 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗢 𝗧𝗪𝗢 𝗭𝗢𝗡𝗘𝗦 (𝟮𝟮𝟭𝟮-𝗔 &amp; 𝟮𝟮𝟭𝟮-𝗕)* <strong>*𝗭𝗢𝗡𝗘 𝟮𝟮𝟭𝟮-𝗔 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗢𝗪 𝗜𝗡 𝗔 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚</strong></span></p><ul><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟯-𝗔(South of S Kidder Creek Loop)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟯-𝗕 (South of Patterson Creek Rd)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟲 (North of Patterson Creek Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟯𝟬𝟭 (Fire footprint)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟬 (South of Kidder Creek Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟭𝟬𝟮 (North of Kidder Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟭𝟬𝟴 (North of Kidder Creek Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟭𝟬𝟱 (North of Quartz Valley Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟭 (South of Scott River Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟯𝟭𝟲 (West of Wrights Lake Road)</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office has issued an&nbsp;𝙀𝙑𝘼𝘾𝙐𝘼𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉&nbsp;𝙒𝘼𝙍𝙉𝙄𝙉𝙂 for the following zone(s):</span></p><ul><li><span>*𝗭𝗢𝗡𝗘 𝟮𝟮𝟭𝟮-𝗔 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗢𝗪 𝗜𝗡 𝗔 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚*</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟲-𝗕&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟯-𝗖&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟰𝟭𝟰 (West of fire footprint)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟱𝟮𝟭 (West of fire footprint)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟰𝟬𝟮 (North of Sawyers Bar Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟯𝟬𝟰 (North of Sawyers Bar Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟯 (North of Sawyers Bar Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟮𝟬𝟵 (East of California Highway 3)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟭𝟭𝟰 (North of Bridge Street)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟭𝟭𝟭 (East of Scott River Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟳 (North of Fort Jones Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟰 (North of Scott River Road)</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟮𝟯𝟲 (North Meamber Creek Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟮𝟯𝟯 (West of Scott River Road)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟭𝟯𝟭𝟯 (South of Forest Route 45n19)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>𝗦𝗜𝗦-𝟯𝟯𝟮𝟭 (East of Kidder Creek Road)</span></li></ul><p>For a more detailed map, please visit <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fprotect.genasys.com%2Fsearch%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2aaUyweZfftIgTru-CtPGWVGKmpCsotSB5628-mHEppTD4gGLWiFu93Xc_aem_h1s6aqCA0Bvvozil4sXwoA&amp;h=AT3xBtqwyXJnt39xpsg3DsiznRfey3L-P5xIHJvZoOlKP53XMwpUXPz5XvABVSM2FlJqgSiqbq2GPWSGQwcoF5PGzgZi6nAhyFNseyAjVRaWmhLS5MscT_yzQHXY9V4kVgMx&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT3WFVRWP9aUN669QCfqO418z7-J71YvKpA7IhBNCB_Iq4ai-nMC3GOT9UGw0BOdI7NhPgwk6Hu-j_OiGZwh9-YSEQzGwqvZ49k1P0J49A_e6dSaUVx6ucsEo4xAsauUfesOdJC7XcZNkPC6FulQkjo91IJcmeRZ2ZBZqMpXvgwGzBB-b2SdH0WuU-PjC7pgYN-SefZ9j3yCXkdNixpQ5MhXvUugFdjVqkqL\"><span>https://protect.genasys.com/search</span></a></p><p>Sign up for alerts at <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Falerts.readysiskiyou.gov%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2KL4ELyCKvg-OhpbtdzyOf9U4KPNbzZbSd_iQHGPMR3kwtkgPznmrIXh4_aem_ZhN1TNGTGQLeayCqtI9E_g&amp;h=AT1teF43OH4h1-mOl9DP67Hsc-12VmW4u6oHiH6v75Q1wZKyNb7kdEwSWF0JWfcZnnV8sl1BJNrpz2yEhRvzrvxAIxyXYTw5de161LnWVkKWXJCPxldSa9UxITQ6F5BknFio&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT3WFVRWP9aUN669QCfqO418z7-J71YvKpA7IhBNCB_Iq4ai-nMC3GOT9UGw0BOdI7NhPgwk6Hu-j_OiGZwh9-YSEQzGwqvZ49k1P0J49A_e6dSaUVx6ucsEo4xAsauUfesOdJC7XcZNkPC6FulQkjo91IJcmeRZ2ZBZqMpXvgwGzBB-b2SdH0WuU-PjC7pgYN-SefZ9j3yCXkdNixpQ5MhXvUugFdjVqkqL\"><span>alerts.readysiskiyou.gov</span></a></p><p>Know your zone: <a href=\"https://protect.genasys.com/search?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2f0dW5U6fte4vm_ATVlgLfWHGGWch7ZSz46IIoTxAuyYzQJVNpoS5nxDg_aem_tiSLniToaEOtVeyxD2YeQg\"><span>https://protect.genasys.com/search</span></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>EVACUATION SHELTER:</strong> An Evacuation Center is available at the following locations for those who have been displaced due to the #SHELLYFIRE:</span></p><p><span><strong>Kahtishraam Wellness Center - (530) 340-3539</strong></span></p><p>1403 Kahtishraam, Yreka, California 96097</p><p><br>RV Dry Camping/Parking</p><p>West Webb St. and Hoag St. in Montague</p><p>Please note, at this time, there are no extra services (sewage/water/power hookups).

Most wildfires in the forest are human-caused, the balance are lightning-caused. The average annual wildfire occurrence has increased steadily over the last 60 years. This increase is attributed to urban encroachment, expanded recreational use of the forest, and old-age chaparral. Chaparral accounts for over 95 percent of the acres burned annually by wildfire.</span></p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "19", "field_title_and_unit": "CALPF 2024 Lake Fire", "field_unit_code": "CALPF", "id": "317871", "lat_deg": "34", "lat_min": "47", "lat_sec": "13", "long_deg": "120", "long_min": "03", "long_sec": "07", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "38004", "title": "2024 Lake Fire", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/calpf-2024-lake-fire"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-117.590833, 34.301944], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "3 hours 14 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2024-07-07T19:53:36-04:00\">2024-07-07</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span><strong>CURRENT SITUATION:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span>The Vista Fire was reported on Sunday, July 7th, 2024, at around 9:51 AM in the San Bernardino National Forest.

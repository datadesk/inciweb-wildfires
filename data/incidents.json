Firefighters used a combination of direct hand line and natural features such as rock faces and boulders along the fire's edge to gain as much containment as possible. Where the fire was not accessible by foot due to hazards and safety concerns firefighters used helicopters to drop water and keep the fire confined to these natural features. Firefighters also constructed contingency line (a fuel break) around the De La Cour Lavender Ranch on Horseshoe Meadows Road, located within the Carroll Creek drainage.</p><p>The first firefighters that arrived on scene did not see any signs of human activity near the fire and there was no lightning activity in the area. This, paired with the limited accessibility by foot, a fire cause could not be determined.</p><p>On November 7 the fire was mapped at 6.4 acres, and hotshot crews assigned to the incident continued coordinating water drops by helicopter as necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 14 and 15, snow fell over the fire area. The fire was contained and controlled, and placed in patrol status on November 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Although no smoke was showing, fires always have the potential to have small, interior pockets of heat until enough precipitation fully extinguishes it. For the following week, the area continued to show no visible smokes even though two wind events passed during that week's timeframe.</p><p>On the evening of November 22, a member of the public reported seeing flames on Horseshoe Meadows Road at 8:19 p.m. and first responders were dispatched to it.</p><p>Evacuations were issued by Inyo County Sheriff's Office for Zone 223A, which included the De La Cour Lavender Ranch. Later, evacuations expanded to other areas, Zones 193, 195, and 197.</p><p>At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 23, this fire made a significant run downslope from the strong west winds spotting embers in several directions, crossing over Horseshoe Meadows Road and spreading east. By 6:30 a.m. the fire had grown to approximately 4,537 acres. By this time, the fire had significantly slowed its rate of spread and received precipitation on it.</p><p>Due to the aggressive firefighting efforts and aided by significant precipitation, containment reached 95% by the evening of November 25.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horseshoe Fire continued to have sections of open fire line in areas completely inaccessible by firefighters due to terrain, and was continually checked on a regular basis for infrared heat and smoke, until it was determined to be 100% contained on January 28, 2025.</p><p>In the most severely burned areas and steep drainages, safety hazards will also exist for some time, such as debris flows, flooding and rock fall. Due to the se hazards, the Inyo County Sheriff's Office may need to reissue evacuation orders, warnings, or advisories.

These aircraft may use multiple arms of Shasta Lake in coordination with other airships using the lake as a water source. These aircraft require a mile of open water to refill their onboard tank. In areas being used by these aircraft, boaters should move toward the shore to ensure the safety of our aircraft, safety of recreational boaters, and to ensure that suppression of the Green Fire will not be hindered.<br><br><strong>CURRENT SITUATION:</strong> <span>Transition is underway on the Green Fire. California Interagency Incident Management Team 10 is integrated with California Interagency Incident Management Team 3 today.&nbsp; Team 3 will assume management of the fire tomorrow. Fire operations are transitioning as well.&nbsp; Contingency crews are shifting focus to suppression repair on the East and West sides of the fire. An incoming weather shift containing strong winds may test fire lines. Crews continue to add depth to containment lines in anticipation of incoming weather. Air Operations Chief Stacy Dickson put it best when reminding the troops at briefing to “keep it inside the lines.” Resources on the ground continue to be supported by aircraft and watercraft as the complexity of operations has not changed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>RESOURCES:</strong> Aircraft resources include 11 helicopters (6 Type 1 airships); 10 Ambulances (6 day / 4 night); 24 Bulldozers; 107 Engines; 46 Crews, 17 of which are Type I Hotshot&nbsp;Crews, and 7 Rapid Extraction Modules (4 day / 2 night). Eleven watercraft are now assigned to Pit River operations. A total of 1,884 individuals are assigned to the fire.</span></p><p><span><strong>FIRE ACTIVITY:</strong> Yesterday, fire activity progressed as expected within the southeastern portion of the fire to the Pit River Arm. The stretches of largely unburned interior fuels toward the eastern flank of the fire, at the Rip Gut Ridge fireline further east, and the Pit River to the south continued to be consumed. Extensive water drops (2.5 million gallons to date) and aggressive holding and suppression repair actions helped reinforce these areas, extinguish dead and downed fuels, and keep the lines intact. At the southwest end of the fire, active fire was held at the shorelines and roads southward from the Sulanharas arm to the Pit River arm of the Lake.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fire suppression boats and Type I helicopters continued to assist crews in strengthening lines in the southwest segment of the fire. Fire behavior was controlled at the eastern flank using Type 1 helicopters supporting crews with water drops and fortifying gains from firing operations along the Rip Gut Ridge fireline.</span></p><p><span><strong>FIRE WEATHER:</strong> There will be elevated fire weather conditions as a cold front approaches the fire today and will move through overnight. Winds will increase with gusts of 20-25 mph and turn more westerly during the evening, and relative humidity will be 17-25% from late afternoon into the evening. This will disrupt the typical overnight and early morning winds. Poor visibility will continue in the morning with smoke drifting south-southwest in the morning and then east-northeast in the afternoon and evening, with improving visibility on south/west parts of the fire by 1300 and possibly eastern portions after 1500. Seasonal temperatures in the 90s will shift after today to lower temps with windier conditions. Aircraft will continue to operate while making allowances for changes in visibility related to winds shifting south-southwest in the morning and then east-northeast in the afternoon and evening.</span></p><p><span><strong>FIRE OPERATIONS:</strong></span> <span>Priority emphasis is on locking down the southern end of the fire. Aircraft and crews near and around Brock Mountain Rd at the west those in the north and northeast of the fire will shift focus slightly to suppression repair while bolstering containment lines. The unburned fuels between the eastern flank of the fire and the Rip Gut Ridge fireline will remain a focal area during today’s elevated weather conditions though much of the area was secured in the previous nights firing operations. Good depth (up to 100ft) was successfully added to lines at the eastern edge. Crews on all firelines will keep “eyes on” heavier and smoldering fuels and stay alert to wind driven reignition. Spot fires will prove more difficult to contain and extinguish in these conditions. Watercraft will continue to provide suppression support along the shore as firefighters further stabilize lines in the southern area of the fire.</span><br><br><strong>INITIAL SITUATION:</strong> The Green Fire started following widespread thunderstorms and lightning on the afternoon and evening of June 30, 2025. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest saw more than 3,100 lightning strikes across the Forest, between June 30 and July 2, resulting in several wildfires. (<a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/cashf-2025-shastatrinity-lightning\"><strong>Wildfire information for other current incidents</strong></a> on the Shasta-Trinity).

We are grateful for the public’s patience and support as we work to contain this fire safely and effectively.

Water drops or rain showers can agitate the loose rock and other unstable debris on the steep hillside above NF Road 2400. &nbsp;Crews are using a grader to help clear the roadway to maintain access for firefighting efforts and escape in case of an emergency.</p><p><br><span>Falling or rolling debris from the fire area, including large boulders and trees will continue to pose a serious hazard to anyone on NF Road 2400 (also known as FS-24, Road 119 and N Lake Cushman Road). Due to this ongoing threat and significant safety concerns, NF Road 2400 is closed, including access to day use, trailheads and other sites beyond the closure point, at mile marker 10.5. This junction is where the pavement ends and the Forest Service road into the Staircase area of Olympic National Park begins. Access to Division 2,3 and 4 remains open.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Due to dry conditions, high fire danger, and the number of interagency resources already dedicated to active incidents, campfires in Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest are restricted to established fire rings starting at 12 a.m. on July 11th, 2025.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evacuation Levels:</strong>&nbsp;While there are no evacuation orders currently in effect, below is a reminder of how to prepare for an evacuation incident:</p><p>Level 1 – READY: Prepare a go kit for you, family, animals.

Ensure you, your family, and animals and ready to go at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Level 3 – GO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grab your go kit. Load your family and animals and leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lake Usage</strong><br>The northwest section of Lake Cushman needs to remain clear. This zone may be needed by firefighting aircraft for scooping and landing.</p><p><br>Public and firefighter safety remains our top priority.

Containment is now 33 percent – up 2 percent from yesterday. Low winds and moderately high humidities allowed crews to continue their progress, increasing containment on the west and south sides of the fire. The warming and drying trend will continue over the next few days, which means the fire could become more active as temperatures rise and humidity drops.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">On the west side of the fire, crews are patrolling for any lingering heat that could ignite under the right conditions. Heavy equipment and firefighters are also engaged in suppression repair, which involves knocking down berms created by dozers and seeding some areas with ecologically appropriate vegetation to help the landscape heal after the fire.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Multiple crews are working on the north side of the fire, constructing line directly on the fire’s edge. Although in rough terrain, trees in that area are smaller (pinyon pine). Fire managers are hopeful that crews will make significant gains in that area in the next few days.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">On the east side of the fire, crews are working to secure the fire perimeter from House Rock Valley Road. Difficult terrain is presenting some challenges, but the fire is not currently growing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">On the southeast portion of the fire, crews conducted a burn operation yesterday to help contain the fire north of Highway 89A. The purpose of burning is to create a barrier of burned fuel that the fire cannot cross. Burning is carefully planned and only executed when conditions are favorable and there are adequate resources in place. In a burning operation, firefighters can control the intensity, speed, and direction of fire to optimize the tactical advantage.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Recent lightning also started two new fires to the south of the main fire. Firefighters responded quickly and are actively engaged in suppression operations.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Highway 89A will remain closed to ensure public safety as well as safe ingress and egress for fire suppression resources.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Fire Weather: </strong>The Incident Meteorologist predicts higher temperatures, no precipitation, and moderate winds today. Due to this, fire activity is expected to increase.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Evacuations:&nbsp;</strong>Local emergency management officials are coordinating closely with fire managers.

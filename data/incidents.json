Fire crews also achieved 100% control of the Muddy fire with active mop up operations. The Muddy fire has now been placed in monitor status by the local BLM Southwest District Fire Unit. &nbsp;This will be the final update for the Muddy fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/2/2025</strong></p><p><strong>8/1/2025 shift summary:</strong></p><p>All fire resources continue to construct fire line around the entire perimeter of the Muddy Fire. The Multi Mission Aircraft (DFPC MMA) flew over the fire utilizing the infrared heat detection capability. The infrared heat scan is a great tool that is used to detect any heat source within the fire perimeter. The infrared image that is generated is transferred to a map and sent to the ground fire resources to help them seek and destroy any heat threats. A photo of the infrared can be viewed in the photos section on this site.</p><p>Fire crews have also begun the early stages of mop up on the Muddy Fire. At this stage, crews will continuously work deeper interior from the fires edge digging out ash pits, digging/grubbing up hot roots and smoldering duff that could cause issues if not addressed. Fire crews continue to staff the fire overnight. Adverse weather conditions continue to be an issue for the fire crews working the Muddy fire due to t-storms and lightning in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8/2/2025</strong></p><p>All fire lines held overnight on the Muddy Fire. Crews remained in place through the night and are back in action for the day shift. Overall plan for the weekend will be finalizing containment around the fires edge on the Muddy Fire. Crews will continue mop up operations, working the fire line edge, securing, patrolling and working deeper interior. Fire behavior has significantly decreased to smoldering and creeping. Fire crews could face another day of challenging fire weather conditions with possible afternoon t-storms and higher winds. Overall, crews continue to produce good safe work.</p><p>The next update for the Muddy Fire will be Monday 8/4/2025, unless any significant events happen.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/1/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Muddy Fire Update:</p><p>* 30% Containment</p><p>* Revised fire perimeter to 3 acres.</p><p>*All fire lines held overnight.</p><p>*Fire crews will continue the construction of fire line and engage in mop up operations.</p><p><strong>Previous day recap</strong>: Fire crews responded to a new start located 2 miles East of the Paonia Reservoir late morning. The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.</p><p>A few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist. Through the heat of the day ground and air resources made good progress with cooling off the fire and constructing fire line.&nbsp;</p><p>By the evening weather conditions started to deteriorate with t-storms and rain moving into the fire area. Aviation resources (due to the weather conditions) had to disengage from the fire, as well as ground fire crews due to lightning exposure. Rain did reach the fire area and crews eventually reengaged the fire. Crews staffed the fire overnight with no flareups to the fire line.</p><p><strong>Plans for today 8/1/2025</strong></p><p>Crews will continue to construct fire line around the fire perimeter, mainly chainsaw (saw) and cold trialing the fires edge. Mop up operations will begin to secure all fire line within a certain depth which will prevent any future threats. Fire crews will look to have the Muddy fire fully contained by the end of shift on 8/1/2025.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update:</strong></p><p>*Fire perimeter resized to 4 acres.</p><p>*Fire crews have been actively engaged with fire line construction. Good progress has been made.</p><p>*Incoming weather has disengaged fire suppression aircraft</p><p>*The Muddy fire is currently receiving light rain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All ground crews will remain on scene of the Muddy fire overnight.

The fire ignited in a remote area 3 miles southwest of Indigo Springs Campground. The fire spread rapidly through the 2009 Tumblebug Fire burn scar, which has many standing and fallen dead trees plus dense brush, and few opportunities for direct control of the fire.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indirect control lines were established around the fire, many along roads or in locations previously used by the Tumblebug Fire. The fire reached some containment lines, but growth of the fire largely stopped due to a combination of recent rainfall and suppression activities. The fire continues to have some small growth in the southwest and east portions of the fire.</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE FOREST</strong>:<span>&nbsp; </span>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/willamette\"><strong>Willamette National Forest</strong></a> is 1,675,407 acres in size. The varied landscape of high mountains, narrow canyons, cascading streams, and wooded slopes offer excellent opportunities for visitors and make the Forest valuable for many purposes.</p><p>The Willamette National Forest is easily accessed from the Willamette Valley cities of Salem, Albany, and Eugene. Four important highways-U.S. Route 20 and Oregon State Routes 22, 58, and 126-cross the Forest. Two National Scenic Byways, McKenzie Pass – Santiam Pass National Scenic Byway and the West Cascades National Scenic Byway take visitors on a tour of tall forests and sparkling water. Over 6,000 miles of road on the Forest offer a chance to get off the beaten path.</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "49", "field_title_and_unit": "ORWIF Emigrant Fire", "field_unit_code": "ORWIF", "id": "325689", "lat_deg": "43", "lat_min": "28", "lat_sec": "7.6", "long_deg": "122", "long_min": "14", "long_sec": "29.8", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "33096", "title": "Emigrant Fire", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/orwif-emigrant-fire"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-115.64, 48.54], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "12 hours 2 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2025-08-25T17:05:32-04:00\">2025-08-25</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span>The Ransome Fire was detected on August 21, 2025 and from a previous lightning storm.

State mobilization was authorized on August 31, bringing in additional resources and strike teams to support local districts/agencies actively involved in initial attack suppression efforts.</p><p>At its peak, the fire reached over 14,000 acres.

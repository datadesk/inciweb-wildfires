Early growth reached several hundred acres within days, ultimately expanding to nearly 4,700 acres. The fire threatened nearby structures and prompted road closures and area restrictions to protect public safety. Fire behavior ranged from smoldering and creeping to isolated torching and spotting under dry, windy conditions. Containment steadily increased as crews conducted mop-up, firing operations, and hazard tree mitigation, with the fire reported at over 90 percent contained in late September.

Resources responding include crews, air attack, and helicopters. The Snow Peak cabin, a valuable recreation site in the alpine area NW of the fire, has been prepped with structure wrap and there have been past fuel treatments in the immediate vicinity of the cabin which significantly lowers the risk of impact.&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "0", "field_title_and_unit": "WACOF Snow Peak", "field_unit_code": "WACOF", "id": "326094", "lat_deg": "48", "lat_min": "33", "lat_sec": "47", "long_deg": "118", "long_min": "28", "long_sec": "1", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "1147", "title": "Snow Peak", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/wacof-snow-peak"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-123.915278, 42.6875], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "1 week 1 day ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2025-09-06T23:42:56-04:00\">2025-09-06</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "Wildland Fire", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Evacuations: </strong></span><strong>Curry County Sheriff John Ward has removed all evacation levels for the Moon Complex.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></strong></p><p><span><strong>There is no camping, hiking or fishing from the bank on the Rogue River between Marial and Foster Bar.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><strong>The Emergency Area and Road Closure for the Moon Complex has been lifted.

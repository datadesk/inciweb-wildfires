Fire crews also achieved 100% control of the Muddy fire with active mop up operations. The Muddy fire has now been placed in monitor status by the local BLM Southwest District Fire Unit. &nbsp;This will be the final update for the Muddy fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/2/2025</strong></p><p><strong>8/1/2025 shift summary:</strong></p><p>All fire resources continue to construct fire line around the entire perimeter of the Muddy Fire. The Multi Mission Aircraft (DFPC MMA) flew over the fire utilizing the infrared heat detection capability. The infrared heat scan is a great tool that is used to detect any heat source within the fire perimeter. The infrared image that is generated is transferred to a map and sent to the ground fire resources to help them seek and destroy any heat threats. A photo of the infrared can be viewed in the photos section on this site.</p><p>Fire crews have also begun the early stages of mop up on the Muddy Fire. At this stage, crews will continuously work deeper interior from the fires edge digging out ash pits, digging/grubbing up hot roots and smoldering duff that could cause issues if not addressed. Fire crews continue to staff the fire overnight. Adverse weather conditions continue to be an issue for the fire crews working the Muddy fire due to t-storms and lightning in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8/2/2025</strong></p><p>All fire lines held overnight on the Muddy Fire. Crews remained in place through the night and are back in action for the day shift. Overall plan for the weekend will be finalizing containment around the fires edge on the Muddy Fire. Crews will continue mop up operations, working the fire line edge, securing, patrolling and working deeper interior. Fire behavior has significantly decreased to smoldering and creeping. Fire crews could face another day of challenging fire weather conditions with possible afternoon t-storms and higher winds. Overall, crews continue to produce good safe work.</p><p>The next update for the Muddy Fire will be Monday 8/4/2025, unless any significant events happen.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/1/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Muddy Fire Update:</p><p>* 30% Containment</p><p>* Revised fire perimeter to 3 acres.</p><p>*All fire lines held overnight.</p><p>*Fire crews will continue the construction of fire line and engage in mop up operations.</p><p><strong>Previous day recap</strong>: Fire crews responded to a new start located 2 miles East of the Paonia Reservoir late morning. The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.</p><p>A few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist. Through the heat of the day ground and air resources made good progress with cooling off the fire and constructing fire line.&nbsp;</p><p>By the evening weather conditions started to deteriorate with t-storms and rain moving into the fire area. Aviation resources (due to the weather conditions) had to disengage from the fire, as well as ground fire crews due to lightning exposure. Rain did reach the fire area and crews eventually reengaged the fire. Crews staffed the fire overnight with no flareups to the fire line.</p><p><strong>Plans for today 8/1/2025</strong></p><p>Crews will continue to construct fire line around the fire perimeter, mainly chainsaw (saw) and cold trialing the fires edge. Mop up operations will begin to secure all fire line within a certain depth which will prevent any future threats. Fire crews will look to have the Muddy fire fully contained by the end of shift on 8/1/2025.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update:</strong></p><p>*Fire perimeter resized to 4 acres.</p><p>*Fire crews have been actively engaged with fire line construction.

Access to much of the fire area has been limited, due to mountain topography, heavy fuel loading and fire intensity.</span></p><p>Firefighters are implementing actions intended to keep the fire out of communities and private property along the Highway 145 corridor and the County Road 38 corridor. Structure Protection groups are working in both corridors, assessing structures, limbing trees and trimming grasses and installing sprinkler systems to proactively protect structures potentially impacted by the fire.</p><p>Dolores County has issued a \"READY\" status notification for the town of Rico.

", "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Horn Fire was reported around 2:30 pm on Wednesday, August 13th. The cause of fire was lightning.&nbsp;</p><p>As of Sunday night, the Horn Fire is 2,800 acres and 50% contained. Moderate winds yesterday supported fire control efforts and the fire is now creeping and smoldering.&nbsp;</p><p>Crews are working on mop up activities around the entire perimeter of the fire. Mop up activities include turning over and mixing smoldering materials and applying water to remaining hot spots. Mop up has been completed 1 chain (66 feet) along the entire perimeter of the fire.&nbsp;</p><p>Resources will continue mop up operations with the objective of creating a cold, secure buffer of 3 chains (198 feet) in from the perimeter. Personnel will also work to suppress activity within the small interior heat patches. Once that is complete, the incident will likely reduce in complexity and the incident commander will begin to release the resources currently assigned. Remaining resources will continue to patrol the fire to extinguish any remaining hot spots and ensure that the fire does not pose a threat to surrounding areas.&nbsp;</p><p>The weather will remain hot and dry, with the chance for gusty and erratic winds in the fire area. Firefighters ask that everyone use caution when recreating this weekend to avoid causing additional fires. Secure chains when towing, and check MTFireInfo.org for fire restrictions. Beaverhead and Madison County are in Stage 1 restrictions, meaning campfires are not allowed unless in a developed campground with an established ring. Always fully extinguish your campfire until it is cold to the touch.&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "50", "field_title_and_unit": "MTMTS Horn Fire", "field_unit_code": "MTMTS", "id": "325197", "lat_deg": "44", "lat_min": "46", "lat_sec": "55", "long_deg": "111", "long_min": "29", "long_sec": "44", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "2800", "title": "Horn Fire", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/mtmts-horn-fire"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-107.373056, 45.982222], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "6 hours 45 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2025-08-14T13:27:38-04:00\">2025-08-14</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p>At approximately 1pm on 8/13/2025, the Summer Springs Fire was reported 13 miles Southeast of Custer, Montana.&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "95", "field_title_and_unit": "MTMTS Summer Springs Fire", "field_unit_code": "MTMTS", "id": "325198", "lat_deg": "45", "lat_min": "58", "lat_sec": "56", "long_deg": "107", "long_min": "22", "long_sec": "23", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "2568", "title": "Summer Springs Fire", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/mtmts-summer-springs-fire"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-117.762583, 46.680861], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "1 day 16 hours ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2025-08-14T14:16:14-04:00\">2025-08-14</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span>This is the final fire update.&nbsp; Central Ferry fire is located approximately 26 miles west of Pullman, WA.&nbsp; The fire started on the afternoon of 8/13/25.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Evacuations: &nbsp;None, all evacuation levels have been lifted.</span></p><p><span>Road Closures: &nbsp;None.</span></p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "99", "field_title_and_unit": "WANES Central Ferry", "field_unit_code": "WANES", "id": "325199", "lat_deg": "46", "lat_min": "40", "lat_sec": "51.1", "long_deg": "-118", "long_min": "14", "long_sec": "14.7", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "6597", "title": "Central Ferry", "type": "Wildfire", "urlPath": "/wanes-central-ferry"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-115.264722, 44.605278], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "14 hours 45 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2025-08-14T17:58:46-04:00\">2025-08-14</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "Wildfire", "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Elkhorn Fire started on July 29th around 5 pm and was lightning caused.

Firefighters used a combination of direct hand line and natural features such as rock faces and boulders along the fire's edge to gain as much containment as possible. Where the fire was not accessible by foot due to hazards and safety concerns firefighters used helicopters to drop water and keep the fire confined to these natural features. Firefighters also constructed contingency line (a fuel break) around the De La Cour Lavender Ranch on Horseshoe Meadows Road, located within the Carroll Creek drainage.</p><p>The first firefighters that arrived on scene did not see any signs of human activity near the fire and there was no lightning activity in the area. This, paired with the limited accessibility by foot, a fire cause could not be determined.</p><p>On November 7 the fire was mapped at 6.4 acres, and hotshot crews assigned to the incident continued coordinating water drops by helicopter as necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 14 and 15, snow fell over the fire area. The fire was contained and controlled, and placed in patrol status on November 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Although no smoke was showing, fires always have the potential to have small, interior pockets of heat until enough precipitation fully extinguishes it. For the following week, the area continued to show no visible smokes even though two wind events passed during that week's timeframe.</p><p>On the evening of November 22, a member of the public reported seeing flames on Horseshoe Meadows Road at 8:19 p.m. and first responders were dispatched to it.</p><p>Evacuations were issued by Inyo County Sheriff's Office for Zone 223A, which included the De La Cour Lavender Ranch. Later, evacuations expanded to other areas, Zones 193, 195, and 197.</p><p>At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 23, this fire made a significant run downslope from the strong west winds spotting embers in several directions, crossing over Horseshoe Meadows Road and spreading east. By 6:30 a.m. the fire had grown to approximately 4,537 acres. By this time, the fire had significantly slowed its rate of spread and received precipitation on it.</p><p>Due to the aggressive firefighting efforts and aided by significant precipitation, containment reached 95% by the evening of November 25.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horseshoe Fire continued to have sections of open fire line in areas completely inaccessible by firefighters due to terrain, and was continually checked on a regular basis for infrared heat and smoke, until it was determined to be 100% contained on January 28, 2025.</p><p>In the most severely burned areas and steep drainages, safety hazards will also exist for some time, such as debris flows, flooding and rock fall.

They are prepping the road to use as a holding feature to keep the fire from advancing toward Fort Thomas and as part of overall suppression efforts. Hand crews and a dozer stayed engaged today on the northwest flank of the fire trying to get around the fire's head. Scoopers were ordered again, but high winds were making their work and support ineffective. Towards late afternoon a helicopter started assisting with bucket work to help the firefighters on the ground. Approximately 240 personnel are supporting the incident including Hotshot crews, hand crews, engines, water tender, medical teams, a dozer and miscellaneous overhead. <span>Resources are trying to keep the fire north of the US 70, east of Fort Thomas, and within its current footprint in the river bed. The fire is burning within the Gila River bottom near the community of Eden in dense salt cedar stands.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today, the Graham County Sheriff's Office initiated a SET notification for residents in the river corridor in the Fort Thomas-area. The SO advises that could go to GO if fire conditions change and threaten public safety. Bryce Fire operations established a trigger point for GO notifications. If the fire reaches that trigger point, the Sheriff's Office will elevate the SET status to GO - or evacuations. Residents should pay attention to the weather and fire conditions and be prepared to evacuate if asked. In addition, SET remains in place for residents between Eden Road and Fort Thomas on the north side of US 70. The US 70 is open, but fire conditions could restrict or delay traffic or force a closure. Drivers are urged to use caution when driving through the area between Fort Thomas and Pima as smoke continues to drift across the highway.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At noon on Saturday, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management transferred command of the fire to the Southeast Zone Type 3 Incident Management Team.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Last night, the fire stayed active throughout the night as southeast winds fueled it to the northwest through the Gila River bottom. Firefighters stayed engaged into the early morning hours working to suppress numerous spot fires and scouting locations for day shift resources to safely engage at the head of the fire. Resources reported working spot fires up to 1/2 mile away. The fire continues to produce extreme fire behavior with long-range spotting and made a six-mile push on Friday. Some infrastructure including power and gas lines were damaged in the fire. There have been no reports of any damaged or destroyed structures. </span>On Thursday night, operations reported the fire 80% contained at 160 acres. Friday morning, high winds spotted the fire over a 25-30' wide containment line along the north side.

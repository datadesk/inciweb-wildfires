Fire crews also achieved 100% control of the Muddy fire with active mop up operations. The Muddy fire has now been placed in monitor status by the local BLM Southwest District Fire Unit. &nbsp;This will be the final update for the Muddy fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/2/2025</strong></p><p><strong>8/1/2025 shift summary:</strong></p><p>All fire resources continue to construct fire line around the entire perimeter of the Muddy Fire. The Multi Mission Aircraft (DFPC MMA) flew over the fire utilizing the infrared heat detection capability. The infrared heat scan is a great tool that is used to detect any heat source within the fire perimeter. The infrared image that is generated is transferred to a map and sent to the ground fire resources to help them seek and destroy any heat threats. A photo of the infrared can be viewed in the photos section on this site.</p><p>Fire crews have also begun the early stages of mop up on the Muddy Fire. At this stage, crews will continuously work deeper interior from the fires edge digging out ash pits, digging/grubbing up hot roots and smoldering duff that could cause issues if not addressed. Fire crews continue to staff the fire overnight. Adverse weather conditions continue to be an issue for the fire crews working the Muddy fire due to t-storms and lightning in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8/2/2025</strong></p><p>All fire lines held overnight on the Muddy Fire. Crews remained in place through the night and are back in action for the day shift. Overall plan for the weekend will be finalizing containment around the fires edge on the Muddy Fire. Crews will continue mop up operations, working the fire line edge, securing, patrolling and working deeper interior. Fire behavior has significantly decreased to smoldering and creeping. Fire crews could face another day of challenging fire weather conditions with possible afternoon t-storms and higher winds. Overall, crews continue to produce good safe work.</p><p>The next update for the Muddy Fire will be Monday 8/4/2025, unless any significant events happen.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update 8/1/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Muddy Fire Update:</p><p>* 30% Containment</p><p>* Revised fire perimeter to 3 acres.</p><p>*All fire lines held overnight.</p><p>*Fire crews will continue the construction of fire line and engage in mop up operations.</p><p><strong>Previous day recap</strong>: Fire crews responded to a new start located 2 miles East of the Paonia Reservoir late morning. The initial fire was reported from a reconnaissance fire detection aircraft by the MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft). The MMA spotted a heat signature and reported the new start to the Montrose Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. The initial size up was .1 size, cause was lightning from the previous day, fire burning in grass, brush and timber. The new start was plotted on BLM land.</p><p>A few hours later, gaining access to the fire, fire resources estimated the fire to be approximately 5 acres and named the incident the Muddy fire. Private property was within the proximity of the fire parameter and fire air resources were ordered to assist. Through the heat of the day ground and air resources made good progress with cooling off the fire and constructing fire line.&nbsp;</p><p>By the evening weather conditions started to deteriorate with t-storms and rain moving into the fire area. Aviation resources (due to the weather conditions) had to disengage from the fire, as well as ground fire crews due to lightning exposure. Rain did reach the fire area and crews eventually reengaged the fire. Crews staffed the fire overnight with no flareups to the fire line.</p><p><strong>Plans for today 8/1/2025</strong></p><p>Crews will continue to construct fire line around the fire perimeter, mainly chainsaw (saw) and cold trialing the fires edge. Mop up operations will begin to secure all fire line within a certain depth which will prevent any future threats. Fire crews will look to have the Muddy fire fully contained by the end of shift on 8/1/2025.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Muddy Fire Update:</strong></p><p>*Fire perimeter resized to 4 acres.</p><p>*Fire crews have been actively engaged with fire line construction. Good progress has been made.</p><p>*Incoming weather has disengaged fire suppression aircraft</p><p>*The Muddy fire is currently receiving light rain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All ground crews will remain on scene of the Muddy fire overnight.

Evacuations are in progress and road closures are now in effect. Los Padres National Forest is currently in unified command with Santa Barbara County Fire. A complex Incident Management Team has been ordered and will in-brief on the evening of Saturday, August 2nd, 2025.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>CURRENT SITUATION:</strong> Today, significant progress was made on the eastern flank of the fire, where fire growth was minimal. Firefighters successfully slowed the fire's southward movement and made progress in constructing fire lines to the west. In the Pine Canyon and Buckhorn Ridge areas, the fire encountered less dense vegetation, which significantly slowed its spread. To the west of the main fire in Huasna Valley, firefighters assessed nearly 100 homes for structure defense.</span></p><p><span>The northwest flank of the fire remains a significant concern as it crossed the power transmission corridor and is continuing to spread towards the north and west. Considerable effort has been made to scout and identify suitable locations for constructing indirect fire lines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tomorrow, there will be a concerted effort on the northwest flank with dozers, engines, water tenders, and hand crews to construct indirect containment lines. These efforts will provide firefighters a strategic foothold aimed at limiting or stopping the growth at the head of the fire.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>EVACUATIONS:</strong> Due to the erratic fire behavior, residents should watch for changing conditions in their area.

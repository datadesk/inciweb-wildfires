Sixty-three percent of primary and indirect control lines have been completed, including indirect control lines between South Fork Drive and Cinnamon Gap, Cinnamon Gap to the top of Case Mountain, and along South Fork Drive. Water hoses and pumps have been placed along the indirect control lines to assist with future fire operations. Three, 10-person Fire Use Modules are identifying control features, such as rock outcrops and other natural barriers, to contain the east flank of the fire.</span></p><p><span>Protecting Three Rivers and adjacent areas is the highest priority, as fire crews are continuing to strengthen and widen indirect control lines on the western and southern flanks. This afternoon, fire crews may begin a strategic firing operation to test burning conditions. This operation will be conducted near the fire’s edge, away from the indirect control line. If tests are successful, a strategic firing operation using a backing fire to control the fire’s intensity and rate of spread will be initiated near Case Mountain, continuing down to South Fork Drive. This operation is anticipated to last several weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>SMOKE IMPACTS:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span>Continued warm and dry conditions will produce more smoke today. The highest smoke concentrations will be in the Mineral King area, with air quality levels moving from MODERATE in the morning to UNHEALTHY later this afternoon. The Giant Forest area can expect to see MODERATE levels during the day, with concentrations increasing to UNHEALTHY overnight. The area from Three Rivers to the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Foothills Visitor Center is seeing increased smoke this morning and will remain between MODERATE and UNHEALTHY FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS today, possibly reaching UNHEALTHY tonight. Pinehurst and Springville can expect to experience MODERATE conditions as well today. Expect increasing smoke impacts later this week as crews begin to execute strategic firing operations.

The project took the whole week to make sure the prescribed fire was an success. Ignitions were completed on Friday, May 12th, for a total of 495 acres treated. Firefighters patrolled and secured the edges for weeks after until moisture came into the area. Check out this YouTube video about the project&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv\">https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the risk of high-intensity wildfire, improve forest health and wildlife habitat, the Bureau of Land Management Tres Rios Field Office has planned a prescribed fire treatment for up to 652 acres on Animas City Mountain in Durango, Colorado. Dependent on weather and the availability of firefighters to conduct the operation, the prescribed burns could take place in spring and fall months. An Environmental Assessment which covers this, as well as other treatment areas in La Plata County, has been completed and is available here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1505044/510\">Final Environmental Assessment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires require a comprehensive plan consisting of 21 elements. The plan outlines the methodical process from inception to completion. The Animas City Mountain project is expected to take 2-3 days for ignitions, with additional time to patrol the area and extinguish hot spots. The mountain has been divided into seven units or compartments. Crews are expected to begin burning on the top of the mountain by slowly lighting an edge that has already been thinned with chainsaws. Once a secure edge or “black line” has been established, firefighters ignite the interior of each unit, one unit at a time. The fire then burns back toward the secured, black edge. This methodical approach allows firefighters opportunities to halt ignitions if burning conditions become undesirable. Examples of undesirable conditions are fire behavior that is too active/not active enough, and poor smoke dispersion. Firefighters will also have water on hand to cool things down if fire activity grows beyond a desirable level.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires are watched carefully by firefighters around the burn, lookouts at more distant locations, aerially (helicopters, planes, drones), and with calibrated smoke monitors. These monitors will be placed at locations around the burn to track smoke impacts in real time. The BLM and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Air Quality (CPDHE) have been working since 2018 to develop a permit that accomplishes the burn while minimizing smoke impacts to the surrounding area. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>. Prescribed fires are a tool to minimize smoke impacts to communities by careful selection of when fires burn and when they stop. Firefighters utilize compartments to halt the fire from spreading overnight, whereas wildfire continue to burn overnight when smoke is likely to settle into low lying areas where communities are located. Residual smoke from the interior areas of the compartments is anticipated, but the goal is to start early in the day and stop early in the evening to give material as much time as possible to be consumed before night-time cooling occurs and smoke sinks into the valley.</p>\n\n<p>Ideal timing (windows) for the project occurs during the Spring and Fall when conditions are more favorable for low-intensity fire. Fuel (vegetation) and weather conditions must fall within a predetermined “prescription” that is known to yield desirable results while still being controllable by the fire personnel conducting the burn. Dissipation of smoke is also part of the prescription. Prescription development has been done by local fire experts who utilize fire behavior computer modeling software combined with decades of experience conducting prescribed burn in southwest Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>This project is a coordinated effort between the federal/county/local government, NGOs, emergency managers, fire departments, public health officials, state smoke regulators and nearby residents. The burn is planned to take place over the course of 2-3 days. Brief closure of Animas City Mountain during the ignitions will occur for public and firefighter safety. The containment lines used for the project will consist of BLM designated trails. The units will be ignited using a combination of ground and aerial resources and will be patrolled/mopped up until out.</p>\n\n<p>The project is part of the BLM’s ongoing commitment to protecting human health and safety while maintaining or enhancing forest and woodland health and functionality. The Animas City Mountain area was previously masticated in 2010 which altered the vertical structure of the forest stand to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Mastication is a treatment method where the understory is mowed and mulched with a large machine. The mulched material slowly decomposes, while the understory regrows. Mastication and prescribed fire are effective in preventing fires from leaving the ground and becoming “crown” fires where the entire trees or stand of trees burn. Treatments thin and remove some of the large dense understory or “ladder fuels”.</p>\n\n<p>Vegetation, however, grows back and requires maintenance. Prescribed fire is the best treatment option for this forest type, if possible, after the initial mechanical treatment. While consuming some of the standing vegetation; prescribed fire also eliminates material left on the ground from both mastication and the natural shedding of leaves, needles, etc. Fire is the only natural process used as a treatment method and produces the most effective results for hazardous fuel reduction while enhancing woodland health. Ponderosa pine woodlands are a drought resistant species that have evolved with a natural cycle of frequent, low-intensity fire.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fire mimics this natural process and improves forage for wildlife, as well as increasing plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where grasses and flowers can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Every year the west is impacted by large catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and other treatment methods lessen the impacts of future fires and increase the likelihood firefighters can work safely and be effective at stopping fires in and near treated areas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "0", "field_title_and_unit": "COSJD Animas City Mountain Prescribed Burn", "field_unit_code": "COSJD", "id": "291575", "lat_deg": "37", "lat_min": "19", "lat_sec": "24", "long_deg": "107", "long_min": "52", "long_sec": "19", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "", "title": "Animas City Mountain Prescribed Burn", "type": "Prescribed Fire", "urlPath": "/cosjd-animas-city-mountain-prescribed-burn"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-108.825556, 37.9025], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "2 days 3 hours ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2021-09-23T08:43:22-04:00\">2021-09-23</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Bureau of Land Management Southwest District plans to conduct several prescribed burns beginning early October or as conditions allow.

The strategy, called “</span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis\"><span>Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A Strategy for Protecting Communities and Improving Resilience in America’s Forests</span></a><span>,” combines a historic investment of congressional funding with years of scientific research and planning into a national effort that will dramatically increase the scale and pace of forest health treatments over the next decade. Through the strategy, the agency will work with states, Tribes and other partners to addresses wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient.</span></p><p><span>In early 2023, the USDA Forest Service added </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/WCS-Second-Landscapes.pdf\"><span>11 additional landscapes</span></a><span>. This announcement followed a year of progress in collaborating with partners across 10 initial landscapes to address wildfire risk to infrastructure and communities. One of these 11 additional landscapes is the Cleveland National Forest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Cleveland National Forest fire crews are starting to conduct fuel treatment operations. These projects will continue through 2023 and into spring 2024. These fuel treatment operations will include vegetation thinning, cutting and piling, mastication, prescribed fire by burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.&nbsp; Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely in fire prone areas and improve forest health. To view project information for each district please go to projects page: </span><a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-publication/cacnf-2024-cleveland-national-forest-fuel-treatments/2024-cnf-projects-01-01-2024\"><span>2024 CNF Projects</span></a></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>The objective of the projects is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape. In fiscal year 2023, the Forest's target for fuels reduction is 6,900 acres. 2,400 acres of planned prescribed fire, and 3,500 acres of mechanical treatments which is a combination of mastication, cut and pile with chainsaws.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully managed and monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.</span><br><br><span>Additional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on this page&nbsp;and the forest’s social media on X (formally known as Twitter) at&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/clevelandnf\"><span>https://twitter.com/clevelandnf</span></a><span> and Facebook at </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clevelandnf\"><span>https://www.facebook.com/clevelandnf</span></a></p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "", "field_title_and_unit": "CACNF 2024 Cleveland National Forest Forest Health Treatments", "field_unit_code": "CACNF", "id": "312808", "lat_deg": "33", "lat_min": "37", "lat_sec": "33.895", "long_deg": "117", "long_min": "25", "long_sec": "57.568", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "", "title": "2024 - Cleveland National Forest, Forest Health Treatments ", "type": "Prescribed Fire", "urlPath": "/cacnf-2024-cleveland-national-forest-forest-health-treatments"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-106.193389, 36.994331], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "3 weeks 3 days ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2023-06-19T12:01:10-04:00\">2023-06-19</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><strong>This project is currently in the planning stages for Spring 2024.</strong></p><p>The Rio Grande National Forest (RGNF) in Colorado and Carson National Forest in New Mexico are planning to initiate a broadcast prescribed fire to the south of Mogote, CO and northeast of Chama, NM.

The project area includes Cow Creek, Calamity Creek, and Indian Creek. The Cow Creek Prescribed Burn is being accomplished using joint-agency fire resources, utilizing both aerial and hand ignitions, and&nbsp;is being closely monitored to ensure that the burn area remains within the designated boundaries.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prescribed burning is a tool that re-introduces fire into the ecosystem to promote and regenerate healthy trees and habitat conditions. This type of fire management strategy is important to maintain a fire-adapted ecosystem and is essential for wildfire prevention. Before conducting a prescribed burn, extensive planning takes place to establish proper parameters such as weather, fuel conditions, smoke dispersion, staffing, and other agency coordination. A prescribed fire is a planned fire used to accomplish management objectives. One of the objectives for this burn is to reduce the overgrown and crowded fuels in the area, therefore creating a mosaic landscape that is more resistant to catastrophic wildfire. This prescribed fire is also aiming to enhance productive vegetation in the oak brush and mountain shrub parts of the burn area, in order to increase habitat for wildlife and livestock. &nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Significant coordinating efforts occur with local landowners, protection partners, and other cooperating agencies to ensure the burn is conducted safely.&nbsp;The safety of firefighters and the public are the most important factors considered when planning prescribed fires.&nbsp;For more information on prescription burning and its use, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire\"><span>https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire</span></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dispersed recreation in the prescribed fire project areas may be impacted.

Without fire, hazardous fuels can build up and carry wildfire from the forest floor to tree canopies, creating extreme fire behavior that poses risk to firefighters, surrounding communities and natural resources. Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service’s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored.

The 112-acre unit comprised of masticated oak, pinyon, juniper and aspen. It had been mechanically treated and prepped this past fall under a keystone agreement with the National Forest Foundation.

Once ignited, firefighters will monitor and patrol the units until they declare the fire out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Planning and implementation for this project have been a collaborative effort between the GMUG National Forests’ Ouray Ranger District, BLM-Uncompahgre Field Office, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the West Region Wildfire Council, the Mullin’s Ranch and multiple other landowners.

", "field_incident_overview": "<p>Every spring and fall, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, along with its interagency partners and neighbors, plans to implement prescribed fire projects, as weather and fuels conditions allow.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Prescribed fires are carefully planned and conducted in accordance with a written burn plan. Prior to implementation, Forest fire managers coordinate with local cooperators, county officials, and interagency partners. When prescription criteria are met, firefighters implement, monitor, and patrol each burn to ensure it meets forest health and public safety objectives. All prescribed fires will be implemented in compliance with Montana air quality standards and coordinated with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the appropriate county health departments to minimize the impacts of smoke. Smoke may pool in drainage bottoms and along highway corridors overnight; impacts are expected to dissipate in a few days.</p><p><br>Why use prescribed fires? Prescribed fires help reduce surface fuels, increasing landscape wildfire resilience and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects on the landscape. In addition, they improve and maintain forest health and wildlife habitat and eliminate invasive species. The forest ecosystems in the Northern Rockies have evolved with fire, with many of them relying on periodic fires to establish and maintain forest health.&nbsp;</p><p>Benefits of prescribed fire as a forest management tool:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protects communities and infrastructure by reducing hazardous fuels and the risk of future high-intensity wildfires.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigates future wildfire risk and promote resilient fire-adapted landscapes.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduces build-up of flammable vegetation, dead and down trees, and overgrowth.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improves and supports wildlife habitat for many species on the Forest.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits the spread of invasive plant species and minimizes the spread of pest insects and disease, maintaining native ecosystems.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycles nutrients back into the soil.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotes the growth of trees, plants, wildflowers, and other flora and fauna.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continues the historic, natural fire regime of periodic disturbance by fire in forested ecosystems.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we plan? Prescribed fires are planned for various units across the Forest; however, the window of opportunity for prescribed fire implementation is affected by several factors. Safety factors, weather conditions, air quality, personnel availability, and environmental regulations are continually monitored before implementation to determine feasibility of moving forward with the prescribed fire operations, during implementation, and after completion of the unit(s).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Public notifications: Prior to initiating the prescribed fires, fire professionals assess conditions, conduct a test burn, and notify local governments and interested publics via website postings, email, social media, and news releases. Implementation and accomplishment updates will also be posted to the Forest website, Inciweb, and the Forest Facebook page.</p><p><br>Safety and monitoring: Trained fire professionals who have studied fire behavior and fire control techniques conduct prescribed fires in such a way to ensure the safety of the fire crew, nearby residents, and property.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "", "field_title_and_unit": "MTBDF BeaverheadDeerlodge NF Prescribed Fire Operations", "field_unit_code": "MTBDF", "id": "317157", "lat_deg": "45", "lat_min": "35", "lat_sec": "55.38", "long_deg": "113", "long_min": "7", "long_sec": "11.42", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "", "title": "Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF Prescribed Fire Operations", "type": "Prescribed Fire", "urlPath": "/mtbdf-beaverheaddeerlodge-nf-prescribed-fire-operations"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-115.502639, 46.640825], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "1 week 2 days ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2024-04-18T12:35:23-04:00\">2024-04-18</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p><span><strong>Given forecasted weather showing an increase in moisture and a decrease in temperatures, we will pause burning operations, until a more favorable weather window presents itself.

Historically, fire was ignited by lightning and by Indigenous people tending the land. Fire in its natural role reduces dead vegetation, replenishes nutrients in the soil, stimulates new growth, and maintains biological diversity.</p><p>Fire was effectively removed from these systems with the arrival of settlers. After many years of fire exclusion, an ecosystem that needs periodic fire becomes unhealthy. Trees become stressed by overcrowding, fire-dependent species disappear, and an unnatural buildup of flammable fuels that can become hazardous when wildfires occur. Over a century of fire suppression has resulted in wildfires burning more severely than they historically did, threatening communities and ecosystems.</p><p>“Prescribed fire is an excellent opportunity to reintroduce a natural process and critical element back into the ecosystem on our terms and in strategic locations,” said Kelsey Lofdahl, Assistant Forest Fire Management Officer on the Klamath National Forest. “It is one of the most useful tools to help reduce fuels, restore our forests, and protect our communities and natural resources.”</p><p>Recent research conducted by the Pacific Southwest Research Station on the Klamath National Forest has illustrated the effectiveness of prescribed burning at reducing the severity of wildfires within treated areas. The study, released in February of this year, found that where the 2021 Antelope Fire intersected with previously completed fuels treatments, including prescribed burning, the severity of the burned area decreased compared to untreated areas.</p><p>Several prescribed burns are planned across the Klamath National Forest this spring. Timing of implementation will be dependent on fuel and weather conditions at each specific project location.</p><p>Happy Camp/Oak Knoll Ranger District<br>•The Cade Mountain prescribed burn (111 acres) is 3 miles northeast of Happy Camp in mixed conifer and hardwood forest. The project aims to reduce fuels in the area and enhance the growth of Hazel for Tribal use.</p><p>Salmon/Scott River Ranger District<br>•Crews plan to pick up where they left off last fall continuing ignitions out at the Scott Bar Mountain prescribed burn (500 acres) about 12 miles west of Fort Jones. The burn goals are to improve defensibility of homes in the area, increase resiliency of the forested stand against future wildfire events, and improve wildlife habitat. Scott Bar Mountain connects to a series of ridgetop fuels treatments, many of which were planned and implemented through collaborative efforts with partners. These treatments create a landscape-scale fuel break that can be used during wildfire events to protect communities, infrastructure, and natural resources.<br>•Just east of the Scott Bar Mountain project area lies the Singleton Project (500 acres), which is in mixed conifer stands and will tie in to the same strategic ridgetop fuel break.</p><p>Goosenest Ranger District<br>•The Van Bremmer (160 acres) and Tamarack (369 acres) underburns are two adjacent projects located three miles northeast of Tennant. The projects’ goals are to reduce hazardous fuels, promote browse for big game, and increase stand resilience against the effects of insects, disease, and wildfire. Both projects are in ponderosa pine stands with an understory of brush and white fir saplings.&nbsp;<br>•The First Creek prescribed burn (up to 1,174 acres) project is north of the Grass Lake Rest Area in mixed conifer with an understory of bitterbrush, manzanita, and snowbrush. Prescribed fire is being used to reduce surface fuel loads and reducing fire-intolerant white fir to create openings that favor fire-tolerant ponderosa pine regeneration.<br>•The Cedar Mountain prescribed burn (up to 3,650 acres) is just north of Antelope Sink, in ponderosa pine stands with areas of juniper and brush. Prescribed fire will be used to reduce fuels to improve defensible space for the community of Tennant and outlying residences. Other goals for the burn are to improve big game habitat, reduce juniper, encourage aspen regeneration, and promote forested stands that are resilient against drought, wildfire, and forest pests.</p><p>Prescribed burning activities on the Klamath National Forest are in conjunction with the efforts of Klamath River Basin Landscape, which is part of the USDA Forest Service’s Wildfire Crisis Strategy.

Additionally, fire managers use prescribed fire to improve forest health, remove hazardous fuels, increase firefighter safety, enhance wildlife habitat, and protect communities and watersheds. Prescribed burns are designed to meet specific objectives and are always managed with firefighter and public safety as the priority.</span></p>", "field_percent_of_perimeter": "", "field_title_and_unit": "NMCIF Mt Taylor RD East La Jara Prescribed Fire", "field_unit_code": "NMCIF", "id": "317283", "lat_deg": "35", "lat_min": "15", "lat_sec": "23.52", "long_deg": "107", "long_min": "41", "long_sec": "10.8", "measurement_type": "Acres", "size": "956", "title": "Mt Taylor RD: East La Jara Prescribed Fire", "type": "Prescribed Fire", "urlPath": "/nmcif-mt-taylor-rd-east-la-jara-prescribed-fire"}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-115.585167, 45.849667], "type": "Point"}, "properties": {"changed": "7 hours 22 minutes ago", "created": "<time datetime=\"2024-05-16T14:47:55-04:00\">2024-05-16</time>\n", "field_active": "1", "field_incident_description": "", "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Muddy Moose Prescribed Burn will continue with burning operations today, May 16, as weather and fuel conditions remain favorable.

Pile burning helps eliminate branches, limbs, twigs and small logs that can't easily be removed through other means due to topography, access or cost feasibility. Pile burning typically follows forest thinning projects in overgrown forests. If heavy machinery was used to conduct the thinning, the piles may be much larger than if thinning and piling was completed by hand using chainsaws.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before burning piles, fire managers track hyper-localized weather forecasts to check temperatures, snowpack conditions and wind. Snow and cooler temperatures are key tools in helping contain fire behavior while wind is an important factor in aiding smoke dispersal. Firefighters use air quality monitoring stations in areas where they plan on burning.</span></p><p><span>Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Mild fire behavior between piles is expected and is also beneficial for future wildfire risk reduction. This can include forest litter between piles and lower limbs of trees. &nbsp;Once burning has begun, firefighters patrol and monitor burned piles until there is no longer any heat emitted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This work is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001GivvFcc-tevUzDYrb0Gg4UpVPrfqSVl4JAAusVwHGRLqUMVRAXqh62er91EqRMexV5h4aIUoB0Yk5CJIEi6z9lLwq-Ydxeub9V334nOSX2nXnq5BrpHeyR0ofshlyQREJm_TLpC4h3eaGamv4e1tGQvPi1Y0ykgD-tOJyaYFUreY6cGA2KIlUYDeTwnG6NhA%26c%3Dp9KqBFwz5AmuJUEREBmnKB7Uubc2Apvfey7W_5_-v6jwmIxlSQc7xg%3D%3D%26ch%3Dcp3EVjrm9p78Ut1VlhMYW2acMfEeS6DsVCfX1tHbtHhsUi5EMFpE8Q%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cvictoria.ibarra%40usda.gov%7C93a28af96c9c49c0ace308dbe172625f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638351653617355410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WBQ7IgL6IwVgqu%2FkJCbEQK%2BlJFwhO1iMxUXqgxiAgpg%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>National Wildfire Crisis Strategy</strong></span></a><span>&nbsp;effort to reduce the impacts of unplanned, large-scale fires on watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and communities.

or as conditions allow. The prescribed burn projects will be on the Gunnison, Tres Rios and Uncompahgre Field Offices. The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity. &nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nWhile no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented.

The project area is located near Gross Reservoir and Winiger Ridge in Boulder County, Colo. The entire project area encompasses 18,954 acres; 9,940 of those acres are National Forest System lands, 1,892 acres are Boulder County Parks and Open Space lands, and 7,122 acres are private lands. Elevation ranges from 6,082 to 8,945 feet. The project is generally located east of Nederland, CO and west of Gross Reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The broadcast burn units from the Forsythe II Decision are located 7 miles southwest of Boulder and 5.5 miles east of Nederland and total 931 acres. Forest thinning and pile burning treatments for areas near the planned prescribed burn area are mostly complete. The area has two main burn units that are subdivided into multiple sub-units that vary in size from 18 acres to 130 acres to provide a variety of options for control using existing roads, water, natural features and control lines, up to 340 acres per year. The prescribed burning treatments will be implemented over several years, with the amount treated per year dependent on weather, ground conditions, and available resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All burning will be implemented in close coordination and with assistance from local cooperating agencies and partners, including Boulder Watershed Collective, Boulder County Fireshed, state and county public health agencies, and multiple local agency fire cooperators.</p><p><span>Smoke will be in the air, and fire managers work closely with experts to minimize the impacts to the extent possible. Air quality is carefully monitored before and during a prescribed fire and all prescribed burns comply with state air quality regulations to minimize impacts to communities.

The strategy, called “</span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis\"><span>Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A Strategy for Protecting Communities and Improving Resilience in America’s Forests</span></a><span>,” combines a historic investment of congressional funding with years of scientific research and planning into a national effort that will dramatically increase the scale and pace of forest health treatments over the next decade. Through the strategy, the agency will work with states, Tribes and other partners to addresses wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient.</span></p><p><span>In early 2023, the USDA Forest Service added </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/WCS-Second-Landscapes.pdf\"><span>11 additional landscapes</span></a><span>. This announcement followed a year of progress in collaborating with partners across 10 initial landscapes to address wildfire risk to infrastructure and communities. One of these 11 additional landscapes is the Cleveland National Forest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Cleveland National Forest fire crews are starting to conduct fuel treatment operations. These projects will continue through 2023 and into spring 2024. These fuel treatment operations will include vegetation thinning, cutting and piling, mastication, prescribed fire by burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.&nbsp; Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely in fire prone areas and improve forest health.

Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>The objective of the projects is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape. In fiscal year 2023, the Forest's target for fuels reduction is 6,900 acres. 2,400 acres of planned prescribed fire, and 3,500 acres of mechanical treatments which is a combination of mastication, cut and pile with chainsaws.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted.

Careful consideration of weather, fuels conditions and resource availability in the area will be given, prior to the fire being started.</p><p>Three separate burn units are planned for this 700 to 900-acre prescribed fire which includes 192 acres on the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. Fire managers from both agencies are closely coordinating on this prescribed fire.</p><p>The general location of the prescribed fire is south of Mogote, CO just southeast of RGNF Forest Road 103, along the 103.2B on the west and 125.2B on the east. The south units are bound by Carson NF Road 75 and on the west by the 494 Road.

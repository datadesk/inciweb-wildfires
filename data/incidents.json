Firefighters used a combination of direct hand line and natural features such as rock faces and boulders along the fire's edge to gain as much containment as possible. Where the fire was not accessible by foot due to hazards and safety concerns firefighters used helicopters to drop water and keep the fire confined to these natural features. Firefighters also constructed contingency line (a fuel break) around the De La Cour Lavender Ranch on Horseshoe Meadows Road, located within the Carroll Creek drainage.</p><p>The first firefighters that arrived on scene did not see any signs of human activity near the fire and there was no lightning activity in the area. This, paired with the limited accessibility by foot, a fire cause could not be determined.</p><p>On November 7 the fire was mapped at 6.4 acres, and hotshot crews assigned to the incident continued coordinating water drops by helicopter as necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 14 and 15, snow fell over the fire area. The fire was contained and controlled, and placed in patrol status on November 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Although no smoke was showing, fires always have the potential to have small, interior pockets of heat until enough precipitation fully extinguishes it. For the following week, the area continued to show no visible smokes even though two wind events passed during that week's timeframe.</p><p>On the evening of November 22, a member of the public reported seeing flames on Horseshoe Meadows Road at 8:19 p.m. and first responders were dispatched to it.</p><p>Evacuations were issued by Inyo County Sheriff's Office for Zone 223A, which included the De La Cour Lavender Ranch. Later, evacuations expanded to other areas, Zones 193, 195, and 197.</p><p>At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 23, this fire made a significant run downslope from the strong west winds spotting embers in several directions, crossing over Horseshoe Meadows Road and spreading east. By 6:30 a.m. the fire had grown to approximately 4,537 acres. By this time, the fire had significantly slowed its rate of spread and received precipitation on it.</p><p>Due to the aggressive firefighting efforts and aided by significant precipitation, containment reached 95% by the evening of November 25.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horseshoe Fire continued to have sections of open fire line in areas completely inaccessible by firefighters due to terrain, and was continually checked on a regular basis for infrared heat and smoke, until it was determined to be 100% contained on January 28, 2025.</p><p>In the most severely burned areas and steep drainages, safety hazards will also exist for some time, such as debris flows, flooding and rock fall. Due to the se hazards, the Inyo County Sheriff's Office may need to reissue evacuation orders, warnings, or advisories.
